## Summary

HellPot is an endless honeypot based on [Heffalump](https://github.com/carlmjohnson/heffalump) that sends unruly HTTP bots to hell.

Notably it implements a [toml configuration file](https://github.com/knadh/koanf), has [JSON logging](https://github.com/rs/zerolog), and comes with significant performance gains.

## Grave Consequences

Clients (hopefully bots) that disregard `robots.txt` and connect to your instance of HellPot will **suffer eternal consequences**.

HellPot will send an infinite stream of data that is _just close enough_ to being a real website that they might just stick around until their soul is ripped apart and they cease to exist.

Under the hood of this eternal suffering is a markov engine that chucks bits and pieces of [The Birth of Tragedy (Hellenism and Pessimism)](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51356/51356-h/51356-h.htm) by Friedrich Nietzsche at the client~~~~ using [fasthttp](https://github.com/valyala/fasthttp), or optionally you may synchronize HellPot with your nightmares by using the `-g`/`--grimoire` flag

## Building From Source

HellPot should probably be built with Go version 1.17 or higher.

HellPot uses [go modules](https://go.dev/blog/using-go-modules). This should make it dead simple to build with a stock Go installation. To make it even simpler, we've added a GNU Makefile.

1 ) `git clone https://github.com/yunginnanet/HellPot`

2 ) `cd HellPot`

4 ) `make`

5 ) _Consider the potential grave consequences of your actions._

## Usage

### YOLO Method:

In the event of a missing configuration file, HellPot will attempt to place it's default config in **$HOME/.config/HellPot/config.toml**. This allows irresponsible souls to begin raining hellfire with ease, **_immediately_**:

1 ) Download a [compiled release](https://github.com/yunginnanet/HellPot/releases/latest)

2 ) Run binary and immediately begin sending clients directly to hell.

---

### Reasonable Method:

1 ) Configure webserver as reverse proxy (see below)

2 ) `./HellPot --genconfig `

3 ) Edit your newly generated `config.toml` as desired.

4 ) Ponder your ~~existence~~ server's ability to handle your chosen performance values.

5 ) ./HellPot -c config.toml

## Configuration Reference


> [!TIP]
> Configuration values can be overridden with environment variables prefixed with `HELLPOT_`.
> When using this method, replace underscores in configuration keys with two underscores.
>
> e.g:
> to set `http.bind_addr` via env, set `HELLPOT_HTTP_BIND__ADDR="x.x.x.x"`


```toml
[deception]
  # Used as "Server" HTTP header. Note that reverse proxies may hide this.
  server_name = "nginx"

[http]
  # TCP Listener (default)
  bind_addr = "127.0.0.1"
  bind_port = "8080"

  # header name containing clients real IP, for reverse proxy deployments
  real_ip_header = 'X-Real-IP'

  # this contains a list of blacklisted useragent strings. (case sensitive)
  # clients with useragents containing any of these strings will receive "Not found" for any requests.
  uagent_string_blacklist = ["Cloudflare-Traffic-Manager", "curl"]

  # Unix Socket Listener (will override default)
  unix_socket_path = "/var/run/hellpot"
  unix_socket_permissions = "0666"
  use_unix_socket = false

  [http.router]
    # Toggling this to true will cause all GET requests to match. Forces makerobots = false.
    catchall = false
    # Toggling this to false will prevent creation of robots.txt handler.
    makerobots = true
    # Handlers will be created for these paths, as well as robots.txt entries. Only valid if catchall = false.
    paths = ["wp-login.php", "wp-login"]

[logger]
  # verbose (-v)
  debug = true
  # extra verbose (-vv)
  trace = false
  # JSON log files will be stored in the below directory.
  directory = "/home/kayos/.local/share/HellPot/logs/"
  # disable all color in console output. when using Windows this will default to true.
  nocolor = false
  # toggles the use of the current date as the names for new log files.
  use_date_filename = true

[performance]
  # max_workers is only valid if restrict_concurrency is true
  max_workers = 256
  restrict_concurrency = false
```

### Example Reverse Proxy Configs

#### nginx

<details>
  <summary>nginx</summary>

```nginx
location '/robots.txt' {
	proxy_set_header Host $host;
	proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
	proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080$request_uri;
}

location '/wp-login.php' {
	proxy_set_header Host $host;
	proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
	proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080$request_uri;
}
```

</details>

#### Apache

<details>
  <summary>apache (mod_proxy + mod_proxy_http)</summary>

All nonexisting URLs are being reverse proxied to a HellPot instance on localhost, which is set to catchall. Traffic served by HellPot is rate limited to 5 KiB/s.

- Create your normal robots.txt and usual content. Also create the fake Errordocument directory and files (files can be empty). In the example, the directory is "/content/"
- A request on a URL with an existing handler (f.e. a file) will be handled by apache
- Requests on nonexisting URLs cause a HTTP Error 404, which content is served by HellPot
- URLs under the "/.well-known/" suffix are excluded.

```apache
<VirtualHost yourserver>
    ErrorDocument 400 "/content/400"
    ErrorDocument 403 "/content/403"
    ErrorDocument 404 "/content/404"
    ErrorDocument 500 "/content/405"
    <Directory "$wwwroot/.well-known/">
        ErrorDocument 400 default
        ErrorDocument 403 default
        ErrorDocument 404 default
        ErrorDocument 500 default
    </Directory>
    /* HTTP Honeypot / HellPot (need mod_proxy, mod_proxy_http) */
    ProxyPreserveHost	on
    ProxyPass         "/content/" "http://localhost:8080/"
    ProxyPassReverse  "/content/" "http://localhost:8080/"

    /* Rate Limit config, need mod_ratelimit */
    <Location "/content/">
        SetOutputFilter RATE_LIMIT
        SetEnv rate-limit 5
    </Location>

    /* Remaining config */

</VirtualHost>
```
