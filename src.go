<p>Frederick Nietzsche was born at Röcken near Lützen, in the Prussian

province of Saxony, on the 15th of October 1844, at 10 a.m. The day

happened to be the anniversary of the birth of Frederick-William IV.,

then King of Prussia, and the peal of the local church-bells which was

intended to celebrate this event, was, by a happy coincidence, just

timed to greet my brother on his entrance into the world. In 1841,

at the time when our father was tutor to the Altenburg Princesses,

Theresa of Saxe-Altenburg, Elizabeth, Grand Duchess of Olden-burg, and

Alexandra, Grand Duchess Constantine of Russia, he had had the honour

of being presented to his witty and pious sovereign. The meeting seems

to have impressed both parties very favourably; for, very shortly

after it had taken place, our father received his living at Röcken "by

supreme command." His joy may well be imagined, therefore, when a first

son was born to him on his beloved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_i" id="Page_i">[Pg i]</a></span> and august patron's birthday, and

at the christening ceremony he spoke as follows:&mdash;"Thou blessed month

of October!&mdash;for many years the most decisive events in my life have

occurred within thy thirty-one days, and now I celebrate the greatest

and most glorious of them all by baptising my little boy! O blissful

moment! O exquisite festival! O unspeakably holy duty! In the Lord's

name I bless thee!&mdash;With all my heart I utter these words: Bring me

this, my beloved child, that I may consecrate it unto the Lord. My son,

Frederick William, thus shalt thou be named on earth, as a memento of

my royal benefactor on whose birthday thou wast born!"</p>



<p>Our father was thirty-one years of age, and our mother not quite

nineteen, when my brother was born. Our mother, who was the daughter

of a clergyman, was good-looking and healthy, and was one of a very

large family of sons and daughters. Our paternal grandparents, the

Rev. Oehler and his wife, in Pobles, were typically healthy people.

Strength, robustness, lively dispositions, and a cheerful outlook on

life, were among the qualities which every one was pleased to observe

in them. Our grandfather Oehler was a bright, clever man, and quite

the old style of comfortable country parson, who thought it no sin to

go hunting. He scarcely had a day's illness in his life, and would

certainly not have met with his end as early as he did&mdash;that is to say,

before his seventieth year&mdash;if his careless disregard of all caution,

where his health was concerned, had not led to his catching a severe

and fatal cold. In regard to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[Pg ii]</a></span> grand-mother Oehler, who died in her

eighty-second year, all that can be said is, that if all German women

were possessed of the health she enjoyed, the German nation would excel

all others from the standpoint of vitality. She bore our grandfather

eleven children; gave each of them the breast for nearly the whole of

its first year, and reared them all It is said that the sight of these

eleven children, at ages varying from nineteen years to one month, with

their powerful build, rosy cheeks, beaming eyes, and wealth of curly

locks, provoked the admiration of all visitors. Of course, despite

their extraordinarily good health, the life of this family was not

by any means all sunshine. Each of the children was very spirited,

wilful, and obstinate, and it was therefore no simple matter to keep

them in order. Moreover, though they always showed the utmost respect

and most implicit obedience to their parents&mdash;even as middle-aged

men and women&mdash;misunderstandings between themselves were of constant

occurrence. Our Oehler grandparents were fairly well-to-do; for our

grandmother hailed from a very old family, who had been extensive

land-owners in the neighbourhood of Zeitz for centuries, and her father

owned the baronial estate of Wehlitz and a magnificent seat near Zeitz

in Pacht. When she married, her father gave her carriages and horses,

a coachman, a cook, and a kitchenmaid, which for the wife of a German

minister was then, and is still, something quite exceptional. As a

result of the wars in the beginning of the nineteenth century, however,

our great-grandfather lost the greater part of his property.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</a></span></p>



<p>Our father's family was also in fairly comfortable circumstances,

and likewise very large. Our grandfather Dr. Nietzsche (D.D. and

Superintendent) married twice, and had in all twelve children, of whom

three died young. Our grandfather on this side, whom I never knew,

must certainly have been a distinguished, dignified, very learned

and reserved man; his second wife&mdash;our beloved grandmother&mdash;was an

active-minded, intelligent, and exceptionally good-natured woman.

The whole of our father's family, which I only got to know when they

were very advanced in years, were remarkable for their great power of

self-control, their lively interest in intellectual matters, and a

strong sense of family unity, which manifested itself both in their

splendid readiness to help one another and in their very excellent

relations with each other. Our father was the youngest son, and, thanks

to his uncommonly lovable disposition, together with other gifts, which

only tended to become more marked as he grew older, he was quite the

favourite of the family. Blessed with a thoroughly sound constitution,

as all averred who knew him at the convent-school in Rossleben, at

the University, or later at the ducal court of Altenburg, he was tall

and slender, possessed an undoubted gift for poetry and real musical

talent, and was moreover a man of delicate sensibilities, full of

consideration for his whole family, and distinguished in his manners.</p>



<p>My brother often refers to his Polish descent, and in later years

he even instituted research-work with the view of establishing it,

which met with partial success. I know nothing definite concerning

these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span> investigations, because a large number of valuable documents

were unfortunately destroyed after his breakdown in Turin. The family

tradition was that a certain Polish nobleman Nicki (pronounced Nietzky)

had obtained the special favour of Augustus the Strong, King of

Poland, and had received the rank of Earl from him. When, however,

Stanislas Leszcysski the Pole became king, our supposed ancestor became

involved in a conspiracy in favour of the Saxons and Protestants. He

was sentenced to death; but, taking flight, according to the evidence

of the documents, he was ultimately befriended by a certain Earl of

Brühl, who gave him a small post in an obscure little provincial town.

Occasionally our aged aunts would speak of our great-grandfather

Nietzsche, who was said to have died in his ninety-first year, and

words always seemed to fail them when they attempted to describe his

handsome appearance, good breeding, and vigour. Our ancestors, both on

the Nietzsche and the Oehler side, were very long-lived. Of the four

pairs of great-grandparents, one great-grandfather reached the age of

ninety, five great-grandmothers and-fathers died between eighty-two and

eighty-six years of age, and two only failed to reach their seventieth

year.</p>



<p>The sorrow which hung as a cloud over our branch of the family

was our father's death, as the result of a heavy fall, at the age

of thirty-eight. One night, upon leaving some friends whom he had

accompanied home, he was met at the door of the vicarage by our little

dog. The little animal must have got between his feet, for he stumbled

and fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span> backwards down seven stone steps on to the paving-stones

of the vicarage courtyard. As a result of this fall, he was laid up

with concussion of the brain, and, after a lingering illness, which

lasted eleven months, he died on the 30th of July 1849. The early

death of our beloved and highly-gifted father spread gloom over

the whole of our childhood. In 1850 our mother withdrew with us to

Naumburg on the Saale, where she took up her abode with our widowed

grandmother Nietzsche; and there she brought us up with Spartan

severity and simplicity, which, besides being typical of the period,

was quite <i>de rigeur</i> in her family. Of course, Grand-mamma Nietzsche

helped somewhat to temper her daughter-in-law's severity, and in this

respect our Oehler grandparents, who were less rigorous with us,

their eldest grandchildren, than with their own children, were also

very influential. Grandfather Oehler was the first who seems to have

recognised the extraordinary talents of his eldest grandchild.</p>



<p>From his earliest childhood upwards, my brother was always strong

and healthy; he often declared that he must have been taken for a

peasant-boy throughout his childhood and youth, as he was so plump,

brown, and rosy. The thick fair hair which fell picturesquely over his

shoulders tended somewhat to modify his robust appearance. Had he not

possessed those wonderfully beautiful, large, and expressive eyes,

however, and had he not been so very ceremonious in his manner, neither

his teachers nor his relatives would ever have noticed anything at all

remarkable about the boy; for he was both modest and reserved.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span></p>



<p>He received his early schooling at a preparatory school, and later

at a grammar school in Naumburg. In the autumn of 1858, when he was

fourteen years of age, he entered the Pforta school, so famous for the

scholars it has produced. There, too, very severe discipline prevailed,

and much was exacted from the pupils, with the view of inuring them

to great mental and physical exertions. Thus, if my brother seems

to lay particular stress upon the value of rigorous training, free

from all sentimentality, it should be remembered that he speaks from

experience in this respect. At Pforta he followed the regular school

course, and he did not enter a university until the comparatively late

age of twenty. His extraordinary gifts manifested themselves chiefly

in his independent and private studies and artistic efforts. As a boy

his musical talent had already been so noticeable, that he himself

and other competent judges were doubtful as to whether he ought not

perhaps to devote himself altogether to music. It is, however, worth

noting that everything he did in his later years, whether in Latin,

Greek, or German work, bore the stamp of perfection&mdash;subject of course

to the limitation imposed upon him by his years. His talents came very

suddenly to the fore, because he had allowed them to grow for such a

long time in concealment. His very first performance in philology,

executed while he was a student under Ritschl, the famous philologist,

was also typical of him in this respect, seeing that it was ordered

to be printed for the <i>Rheinische Museum.</i> Of course this was done

amid general and grave expressions of doubt; for, as Dr. Ritschl often

declared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span> it was an unheard-of occurrence for a student in his third

term to prepare such an excellent treatise.</p>



<p>Being a great lover of out-door exercise, such as swimming, skating,

and walking, he developed into a very sturdy lad. Rohde gives the

following description of him as a student: with his healthy complexion,

his outward and inner cleanliness, his austere chastity and his solemn

aspect, he was the image of that delightful youth described by Adalbert

Stifter.</p>



<p>Though as a child he was always rather serious, as a lad and a man he

was ever inclined to see the humorous side of things, while his whole

being, and everything he said or did, was permeated by an extraordinary

harmony. He belonged to the very few who could control even a bad mood

and conceal it from others. All his friends are unanimous in their

praise of his exceptional evenness of temper and behaviour, and his

warm, hearty, and pleasant laugh that seemed to come from the very

depths of his benevolent and affectionate nature. In him it might

therefore be said, nature had produced a being who in body and spirit

was a harmonious whole: his unusual intellect was fully in keeping with

his uncommon bodily strength.</p>



<p>The only abnormal thing about him, and something which we both

inherited from our father, was short-sightedness, and this was

very much aggravated in my brother's case, even in his earliest

schooldays, owing to that indescribable anxiety to learn which always

characterised him. When one listens to accounts given by his friends

and schoolfellows, one is startled by the multiplicity of his studies

even in his schooldays.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span></p>



<p>In the autumn of 1864, he began his university life in Bonn, and

studied philology and theology; at the end of six months he gave up

theology, and in the autumn of 1865 followed his famous teacher Ritschl

to the University of Leipzig. There he became an ardent philologist,

and diligently sought to acquire a masterly grasp of this branch of

knowledge. But in this respect it would be unfair to forget that the

school of Pforta, with its staff of excellent teachers&mdash;scholars

that would have adorned the chairs of any University&mdash;had already

afforded the best of preparatory trainings to any one intending to

take up philology as a study, more particularly as it gave all pupils

ample scope to indulge any individual tastes they might have for any

particular branch of ancient history. The last important Latin thesis

which my brother wrote for the Landes-Schule, Pforta, dealt with

the Megarian poet Theognis, and it was in the rôle of a lecturer on

this very subject that, on the 18th January 1866, he made his <i>first

appearance in public</i> before the philological society he had helped to

found in Leipzig. The paper he read disclosed his investigations on

the subject of Theognis the moralist and aristocrat, who, as is well

known, described and dismissed the plebeians of his time in terms of

the heartiest contempt The aristocratic ideal, which was always so

dear to my brother, thus revealed itself for the first time. Moreover,

curiously enough, it was precisely <i>this</i> scientific thesis which was

the cause of Ritschl's recognition of my brother and fondness for him.</p>



<p>The whole of his Leipzig days proved of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span> utmost importance to my

brother's career. There he was plunged into the very midst of a torrent

of intellectual influences which found an impressionable medium in

the fiery youth, and to which he eagerly made himself accessible.

He did not, however, forget to discriminate among them, but tested

and criticised the currents of thought he encountered, and selected

accordingly. It is certainly of great importance to ascertain what

those influences precisely were to which he yielded, and how long

they maintained their sway over him, and it is likewise necessary to

discover exactly when the matured mind threw off these fetters in order

to work out its own salvation.</p>



<p>The influences that exercised power over him in those days may be

described in the three following terms: Hellenism, Schopenhauer,

Wagner. His love of Hellenism certainly led him to philology; but, as

a matter of fact, what concerned him most was to obtain a wide view

of things in general, and this he hoped to derive from that science;

philology in itself, with his splendid method and thorough way of going

to work, served him only as a means to an end.</p>



<p>If Hellenism was the first strong influence which already in Pforta

obtained a sway over my brother, in the winter of 1865-66, a completely

new, and therefore somewhat subversive, influence was introduced into

his life with Schopenhauer's philosophy. When he reached Leipzig in

the autumn of 1865, he was very downcast; for the experiences that

had befallen him during his one year of student life in Bonn had

deeply depressed him. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> sought at first to adapt himself to his

surroundings there, with the hope of ultimately elevating them to his

lofty views on things; but both these efforts proved vain, and now he

had come to Leipzig with the purpose of framing his own manner of life.

It can easily be imagined how the first reading of Schopenhauer's <i>The

World as Will and Idea</i> worked upon this man, still stinging from the

bitterest experiences and disappointments. He writes: "Here I saw a

mirror in which I espied the world, life, and my own nature depicted

with frightful grandeur." As my brother, from his very earliest

childhood, had always missed both the parent and the educator through

our father's untimely death, he began to regard Schopenhauer with

almost filial love and respect. He did not venerate him quite as other

men did; Schopenhauer's <i>personality</i> was what attracted and enchanted

him. From the first he was never blind to the faults in his master's

system, and in proof of this we have only to refer to an essay he

wrote in the autumn of 1867, which actually contains a criticism of

Schopenhauer's philosophy.</p>



<p>Now, in the autumn of 1865, to these two influences, Hellenism and

Schopenhauer, a third influence was added&mdash;one which was to prove

the strongest ever exercised over my brother&mdash;and it began with his

personal introduction to Richard Wagner. He was introduced to Wagner by

the latter's sister, Frau Professor Brockhaus, and his description of

their first meeting, contained in a letter to Erwin Rohde, is really

most affecting. For years, that is to say, from the time Billow's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>

arrangement of <i>Tristan and Isolde</i> for the pianoforte, had appeared,

he had already been a passionate admirer of Wagner's music; but now

that the artist himself entered upon the scene of his life, with the

whole fascinating strength of his strong will, my brother felt that he

was in the presence of a being whom he, of all modern men, resembled

most in regard to force of character.</p>



<p>Again, in the case of Richard Wagner, my brother, from the first, laid

the utmost stress upon the man's personality, and could only regard

his works and views as an expression of the artist's whole being,

despite the fact that he by no means understood every one of those

works at that time. My brother was the first who ever manifested such

enthusiastic affection for Schopenhauer and Wagner, and he was also the

first of that numerous band of young followers who ultimately inscribed

the two great names upon their banner. Whether Schopenhauer and Wagner

ever really corresponded to the glorified pictures my brother painted

of them, both in his letters and other writings, is a question which we

can no longer answer in the affirmative. Perhaps what he saw in them

was only what he himself wished to be some day.</p>



<p>The amount of work my brother succeeded in accomplishing, during his

student days, really seems almost incredible. When we examine his

record for the years 1865-67, we can scarcely believe it refers to only

two years' industry, for at a guess no one would hesitate to suggest

four years at least. But in those days, as he himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span> declares, he

still possessed the constitution of a bear. He knew neither what

headaches nor indigestion meant, and, despite his short sight, his eyes

were able to endure the greatest strain without giving him the smallest

trouble. That is why, regardless of seriously interrupting his studies,

he was so glad at the thought of becoming a soldier in the forthcoming

autumn of 1867; for he was particularly anxious to discover some means

of employing his bodily strength.</p>



<p>He discharged his duties as a soldier with the utmost mental and

physical freshness, was the crack rider among the recruits of his year,

and was sincerely sorry when, owing to an accident, he was compelled to

leave the colours before the completion of his service. As a result of

this accident he had his first dangerous illness.</p>



<p>While mounting his horse one day, the beast, which was an uncommonly

restive one, suddenly reared, and, causing him to strike his chest

sharply against the pommel of the saddle, threw him to the ground. My

brother then made a second attempt to mount, and succeeded this time,

notwithstanding the fact that he had severely sprained and torn two

muscles in his chest, and had seriously bruised the adjacent ribs. For

a whole day he did his utmost to pay no heed to the injury, and to

overcome the pain it caused him; but in the end he only swooned, and a

dangerously acute inflammation of the injured tissues was the result.

Ultimately he was obliged to consult the famous specialist, Professor

Volkmann, in Halle, who quickly put him right.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span></p>



<p>In October 1868, my brother returned to his studies in Leipzig with

double joy. These were his plans: to get his doctor's degree as soon as

possible; to proceed to Paris, Italy, and Greece, make a lengthy stay

in each place, and then to return to Leipzig in order to settle there

as a privat docent. All these plans were, however, suddenly frustrated

owing to his premature call to the University of Bale, where he was

invited to assume the duties of professor. Some of the philological

essays he had written in his student days, and which were published

by the <i>Rheinische Museum,</i> had attracted the attention of the

Educational Board at Bale. Ratsherr Wilhelm Vischer, as representing

this body, appealed to Ritschl for fuller information. Now Ritschl,

who had early recognised my brother's extraordinary talents, must have

written a letter of such enthusiastic praise ("Nietzsche is a genius:

he can do whatever he chooses to put his mind to"), that one of the

more cautious members of the council is said to have observed: "If

the proposed candidate be really such a genius, then it were better

did we not appoint him; for, in any case, he would only stay a short

time at the little University of Bale." My brother ultimately accepted

the appointment, and, in view of his published philological works,

he was immediately granted the doctor's degree by the University of

Leipzig. He was twenty-four years and six months old when he took up

his position as professor in Bale,&mdash;and it was with a heavy heart that

he proceeded there, for he knew "the golden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span> period of untrammelled

activity" must cease. He was, however, inspired by the deep wish of

being able "to transfer to his pupils some of that Schopenhauerian

earnestness which is stamped on the brow of the sublime man." "I

should like to be something more than a mere trainer of capable

philologists: the present generation of teachers, the care of the

growing broods,&mdash;all this is in my mind. If we must live, let us at

least do so in such wise that others may bless our life once we have

been peacefully delivered from its toils."</p>



<p>When I look back upon that month of May 1869, and ask both of friends

and of myself, what the figure of this youthful University professor

of four-and-twenty meant to the world at that time, the reply is

naturally, in the first place: that he was one of Ritschl's best

pupils; secondly, that he was an exceptionally capable exponent of

classical antiquity with a brilliant career before him; and thirdly,

that he was a passionate adorer of Wagner and Schopenhauer. But no one

has any idea of my brother's independent attitude to the science he

had selected, to his teachers and to his ideals, and he deceived both

himself and us when he passed as a "disciple" who really shared all the

views of his respected master.</p>



<p>On the 28th May 1869, my brother delivered his inaugural address

at Bale University, and it is said to have deeply impressed the

authorities. The subject of the address was "Homer and Classical

Philology."</p>



<p>Musing deeply, the worthy councillors and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span> professors walked homeward.

What had they just heard? A young scholar discussing the very

justification of his own science in a cool and philosophically critical

spirit! A man able to impart so much artistic glamour to his subject,

that the once stale and arid study of philology suddenly struck

them&mdash;and they were certainly not impressionable men&mdash;as the messenger

of the gods: "and just as the Muses descended upon the dull and

tormented Boeotian peasants, so philology comes into a world full of

gloomy colours and pictures, full of the deepest, most incurable woes,

and speaks to men comfortingly of the beautiful and brilliant godlike

figure of a distant, blue, and happy fairyland."</p>



<p>"We have indeed got hold of a rare bird, Herr Ratsherr," said one of

these gentlemen to his companion, and the latter heartily agreed, for

my brother's appointment had been chiefly his doing.</p>



<p>Even in Leipzig, it was reported that Jacob Burckhardt had said:

"Nietzsche is as much an artist as a scholar." Privy-Councillor

Ritschl told me of this himself, and then he added, with a smile: "I

always said so; he can make his scientific discourses as palpitatingly

interesting as a French novelist his novels."</p>



<p>"Homer and Classical Philology"&mdash;my brother's inaugural address at

the University&mdash;was by no means the first literary attempt he had

made; for we have already seen that he had had papers published by the

<i>Rheinische Museum</i>; still, this particular discourse is important,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>

seeing that it practically contains the programme of many other

subsequent essays. I must, however, emphasise this fact here, that

neither "Homer and Classical Philology," nor <i>The Birth of Tragedy,</i>

represents a beginning in my brother's career. It is really surprising

to see how very soon he actually began grappling with the questions

which were to prove the problems of his life. If a beginning to his

intellectual development be sought at all, then it must be traced

to the years 1865-67 in Leipzig. <i>The Birth of Tragedy,</i> his maiden

attempt at book-writing, with which he began his twenty-eighth year,

is the last link of a long chain of developments, and the first fruit

that was a long time coming to maturity. Nietzsche's was a polyphonic

nature, in which the most different and apparently most antagonistic

talents had come together. Philosophy, art, and science&mdash;in the form

of philology, then&mdash;each certainly possessed a part of him. The

most wonderful feature&mdash;perhaps it might even be called the real

Nietzschean feature&mdash;of this versatile creature, was the fact that

no eternal strife resulted from the juxtaposition of these inimical

traits, that not one of them strove to dislodge, or to get the upper

hand of, the others. When Nietzsche renounced the musical career, in

order to devote himself to philology, and gave himself up to the most

strenuous study, he did not find it essential completely to suppress

his other tendencies: as before, he continued both to compose and

derive pleasure from music, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span> even studied counterpoint somewhat

seriously. Moreover, during his years at Leipzig, when he consciously

gave himself up to philological research, he began to engross himself

in Schopenhauer, and was thereby won by philosophy for ever. Everything

that could find room took up its abode in him, and these juxtaposed

factors, far from interfering with one another's existence, were rather

mutually fertilising and stimulating. All those who have read the first

volume of the biography with attention must have been struck with the

perfect way in which the various impulses in his nature combined in

the end to form one general torrent, and how this flowed with ever

greater force in the direction of <i>a single goal.</i> Thus science, art,

and philosophy developed and became ever more closely related in him,

until, in <i>The Birth of Tragedy,</i> they brought forth a "centaur," that

is to say, a work which would have been an impossible achievement to

a man with only a single, special talent. This polyphony of different

talents, all coming to utterance together and producing the richest

and boldest of harmonies, is the fundamental feature not only of

Nietzsche's early days, but of his whole development. It is once again

the artist, philosopher, and man of science, who as one man in later

years, after many wanderings, recantations, and revulsions of feeling,

produces that other and rarer Centaur of highest rank&mdash;<i>Zarathustra</i>.</p>



<p><i>The Birth of Tragedy</i> requires perhaps a little explaining&mdash;more

particularly as we have now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span> ceased to use either Schopenhauerian or

Wagnerian terms of expression. And it was for this reason that five

years after its appearance, my brother wrote an introduction to it,

in which he very plainly expresses his doubts concerning the views it

contains, and the manner in which they are presented. The kernel of its

thought he always recognised as perfectly correct; and all he deplored

in later days was that he had spoiled the grand problem of Hellenism,

as he understood it, by adulterating it with ingredients taken from the

world of most modern ideas. As time went on, he grew ever more and more

anxious to define the deep meaning of this book with greater precision

and clearness. A very good elucidation of its aims, which unfortunately

was never published, appears among his notes of the year 1886, and is

as follows:&mdash;</p>



<p>"Concerning <i>The Birth of Tragedy.</i>&mdash;A book consisting of mere

experiences relating to pleasurable and unpleasurable æsthetic states,

with a metaphysico-artistic background. At the same time the confession

of a romanticist <i>the sufferer feels the deepest longing for beauty&mdash;he

begets it</i>; finally, a product of youth, full of youthful courage and

melancholy.</p>



<p>"Fundamental psychological experiences: the word 'Apollonian' stands

for that state of rapt repose in the presence of a visionary world,

in the presence of the world of <i>beautiful appearance</i> designed as a

deliverance from <i>becoming</i>; the word <i>Dionysos,</i> on the other hand,

stands for strenuous becoming, grown self-conscious, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span> form

of the rampant voluptuousness of the creator, who is also perfectly

conscious of the violent anger of the destroyer.</p>



<p>"The antagonism of these two attitudes and the <i>desires</i> that underlie

them. The first-named would have the vision it conjures up <i>eternal</i>:

in its light man must be quiescent, apathetic, peaceful, healed, and

on friendly terms with himself and all existence; the second strives

after creation, after the voluptuousness of wilful creation, <i>i.e.</i>

constructing and destroying. Creation felt and explained as an instinct

would be merely the unremitting inventive action of a dissatisfied

being, overflowing with wealth and living at high tension and high

pressure,&mdash;of a God who would overcome the sorrows of existence by

means only of continual changes and transformations,&mdash;appearance as a

transient and momentary deliverance; the world as an apparent sequence

of godlike visions and deliverances.</p>



<p>"This metaphysico-artistic attitude is opposed to Schopenhauer's

one-sided view which values art, not from the artist's standpoint but

from the spectator's, because it brings salvation and deliverance

by means of the joy produced by unreal as opposed to the existing

or the real (the experience only of him who is suffering and is in

despair owing to himself and everything existing).&mdash;Deliverance in

the <i>form</i> and its eternity (just as Plato may have pictured it, save

that he rejoiced in a complete subordination of all too excitable

sensibilities, even in the idea itself). To this is opposed the second

point of view&mdash;art regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span> as a phenomenon of the artist, above all

of the musician; the torture of being obliged to create, as a Dionysian

instinct.</p>



<p>"Tragic art, rich in both attitudes, represents the reconciliation of

Apollo and Dionysos. Appearance is given the greatest importance by

Dionysos; and yet it will be denied and cheerfully denied. This is

directed against Schopenhauer's teaching of <i>Resignation</i> as the tragic

attitude towards the world.</p>



<p>"Against Wagner's theory that music is a means and drama an end.</p>



<p>"A desire for tragic myth (for religion and even pessimistic religion)

as for a forcing frame in which certain plants flourish.</p>



<p>"Mistrust of science, although its ephemerally soothing optimism be

strongly felt; the 'serenity' of the theoretical man.</p>



<p>"Deep antagonism to Christianity. Why? The degeneration of the Germanic

spirit is ascribed to its influence.</p>



<p>"Any justification of the world can only be an <i>æsthetic</i> one. Profound

suspicions about morality (&mdash;it is part and parcel of the world of

appearance).</p>



<p>"The happiness of existence is only possible as the happiness derived

from appearance. (<i>'Being' is a fiction invented by those who suffer

from becoming</i>.)</p>



<p>"Happiness in becoming is possible only in the <i>annihilation</i> of

the real, of the 'existing,' of the beautifully visionary,&mdash;in the

pessimistic dissipation of illusions:&mdash;with the annihilation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span> of

the most beautiful phenomena in the world of appearance, Dionysian

happiness reaches its zenith."</p>



<p><i>The Birth of Tragedy</i> is really only a portion of a much greater work

on Hellenism, which my brother had always had in view from the time of

his student days. But even the portion it represents was originally

designed upon a much larger scale than the present one; the reason

probably being, that Nietzsche desired only to be of service to Wagner.

When a certain portion of the projected work on Hellenism was ready

and had received the title <i>Greek Cheerfulness,</i> my brother happened

to call upon Wagner at Tribschen in April 1871, and found him very

low-spirited in regard to the mission of his life. My brother was very

anxious to take some decisive step to help him, and, laying the plans

of his great work on Greece aside, he selected a small portion from

the already completed manuscript&mdash;a portion dealing with one distinct

side of Hellenism,&mdash;to wit, its tragic art. He then associated Wagner's

music with it and the name Dionysos, and thus took the first step

towards that world-historical view through which we have since grown

accustomed to regard Wagner.</p>



<p>From the dates of the various notes relating to it, <i>The Birth of

Tragedy</i> must have been written between the autumn of 1869 and November

1871&mdash;a period during which "a mass of æsthetic questions and answers"

was fermenting in Nietzsche's mind. It was first published in January

1872 by E. W. Fritsch, in Leipzig,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span> under the title <i>The Birth of

Tragedy out of the Spirit of Music.</i> Later on the title was changed to

<i>The Birth of Tragedy, or Hellenism and Pessimism.</i></p>

<h4>I.</h4>





<p>Whatever may lie at the bottom of this doubtful book must be a

question of the first rank and attractiveness, moreover a deeply

personal question,&mdash;in proof thereof observe the time in which it

originated, <i>in spite</i> of which it originated, the exciting period

of the Franco-German war of 1870-71. While the thunder of the battle

of Wörth rolled over Europe, the ruminator and riddle-lover, who had

to be the parent of this book, sat somewhere in a nook of the Alps,

lost in riddles and ruminations, consequently very much concerned and

unconcerned at the same time, and wrote down his meditations on the

<i>Greeks,</i>&mdash;the kernel of the curious and almost inaccessible book, to

which this belated prologue (or epilogue) is to be devoted. A few weeks

later: and he found himself under the walls of Metz, still wrestling

with the notes of interrogation he had set down concerning the alleged

"cheerfulness" of the Greeks and of Greek art; till at last, in that

month of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> deep suspense, when peace was debated at Versailles, he too

attained to peace with himself, and, slowly recovering from a disease

brought home from the field, made up his mind definitely regarding the

"Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of <i>Music."</i>&mdash;From music? Music and

Tragedy? Greeks and tragic music? Greeks and the Art-work of pessimism?

A race of men, well-fashioned, beautiful, envied, life-inspiring, like

no other race hitherto, the Greeks&mdash;indeed? The Greeks were <i>in need</i>

of tragedy? Yea&mdash;of art? Wherefore&mdash;Greek art?...</p>



<p>We can thus guess where the great note of interrogation concerning the

value of existence had been set. Is pessimism <i>necessarily</i> the sign of

decline, of decay, of failure, of exhausted and weakened instincts?&mdash;as

was the case with the Indians, as is, to all appearance, the case with

us "modern" men and Europeans? Is there a pessimism of <i>strength</i>? An

intellectual predilection for what is hard, awful, evil, problematical

in existence, owing to well-being, to exuberant health, to <i>fullness</i>

of existence? Is there perhaps suffering in overfullness itself? A

seductive fortitude with the keenest of glances, which <i>yearns</i> for

the terrible, as for the enemy, the worthy enemy, with whom it may try

its strength? from whom it is willing to learn what "fear" is? What

means <i>tragic</i> myth to the Greeks of the best, strongest, bravest era?

And the prodigious phenomenon of the Dionysian? And that which was

born thereof, tragedy?&mdash;And again: that of which tragedy died, the

Socratism of morality, the dialectics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> contentedness and cheerfulness

of the theoretical man&mdash;indeed? might not this very Socratism

be a sign of decline, of weariness, of disease, of anarchically

disintegrating instincts? And the "Hellenic cheerfulness" of the later

Hellenism merely a glowing sunset? The Epicurean will <i>counter</i> to

pessimism merely a precaution of the sufferer? And science itself,

our science&mdash;ay, viewed as a symptom of life, what really signifies

all science? Whither, worse still, <i>whence</i>&mdash;all science? Well? Is

scientism perhaps only fear and evasion of pessimism? A subtle defence

against&mdash;<i>truth!</i> Morally speaking, something like falsehood and

cowardice? And, unmorally speaking, an artifice? O Socrates, Socrates,

was this perhaps <i>thy</i> secret? Oh mysterious ironist, was this perhaps

thine&mdash;irony?...</p>







<h4>2.</h4>





<p>What I then laid hands on, something terrible and dangerous, a

problem with horns, not necessarily a bull itself, but at all events

a <i>new</i> problem: I should say to-day it was the <i>problem of science</i>

itself&mdash;science conceived for the first time as problematic, as

questionable. But the book, in which my youthful ardour and suspicion

then discharged themselves&mdash;what an <i>impossible</i> book must needs

grow out of a task so disagreeable to youth. Constructed of nought

but precocious, unripened self-experiences, all of which lay close

to the threshold of the communicable, based on the groundwork of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>

<i>art</i>&mdash;for the problem of science cannot be discerned on the groundwork

of science,&mdash;a book perhaps for artists, with collateral analytical

and retrospective aptitudes (that is, an exceptional kind of artists,

for whom one must seek and does not even care to seek ...), full of

psychological innovations and artists' secrets, with an artists'

metaphysics in the background, a work of youth, full of youth's mettle

and youth's melancholy, independent, defiantly self-sufficient even

when it seems to bow to some authority and self-veneration; in short,

a firstling-work, even in every bad sense of the term; in spite of its

senile problem, affected with every fault of youth, above all with

youth's prolixity and youth's "storm and stress": on the other hand,

in view of the success it had (especially with the great artist to

whom it addressed itself, as it were, in a duologue, Richard Wagner) a

<i>demonstrated</i> book, I mean a book which, at any rate, sufficed "for

the best of its time." On this account, if for no other reason, it

should be treated with some consideration and reserve; yet I shall not

altogether conceal how disagreeable it now appears to me, how after

sixteen years it stands a total stranger before me,&mdash;before an eye

which is more mature, and a hundred times more fastidious, but which

has by no means grown colder nor lost any of its interest in that

self-same task essayed for the first time by this daring book,&mdash;<i>to

view science through the optics of the artist, and art moreover through

the optics of life....</i></p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>







<h4>3.</h4>





<p>I say again, to-day it is an impossible book to me,&mdash;I call it badly

written, heavy, painful, image-angling and image-entangling, maudlin,

sugared at times even to femininism, uneven in tempo, void of the will

to logical cleanliness, very convinced and therefore rising above the

necessity of demonstration, distrustful even of the <i>propriety</i> of

demonstration, as being a book for initiates, as "music" for those who

are baptised with the name of Music, who are united from the beginning

of things by common ties of rare experiences in art, as a countersign

for blood-relations <i>in artibus.</i>&mdash;a haughty and fantastic book,

which from the very first withdraws even more from the <i>profanum

vulgus</i> of the "cultured" than from the "people," but which also, as

its effect has shown and still shows, knows very well how to seek

fellow-enthusiasts and lure them to new by-ways and dancing-grounds.

Here, at any rate&mdash;thus much was acknowledged with curiosity as well

as with aversion&mdash;a <i>strange</i> voice spoke, the disciple of a still

"unknown God," who for the time being had hidden himself under the

hood of the scholar, under the German's gravity and disinclination for

dialectics, even under the bad manners of the Wagnerian; here was a

spirit with strange and still nameless needs, a memory bristling with

questions, experiences and obscurities, beside which stood the name

Dionysos like one more note of interrogation; here spoke&mdash;people said

to themselves with misgivings&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> something like a mystic and almost

mænadic soul, which, undecided whether it should disclose or conceal

itself, stammers with an effort and capriciously as in a strange

tongue. It should have <i>sung,</i> this "new soul"&mdash;and not spoken! What

a pity, that I did not dare to say what I then had to say, as a poet:

I could have done so perhaps! Or at least as a philologist:&mdash;for even

at the present day well-nigh everything in this domain remains to be

discovered and disinterred by the philologist! Above all the problem,

<i>that</i> here there <i>is</i> a problem before us,&mdash;and that, so long as we

have no answer to the question "what is Dionysian?" the Greeks are now

as ever wholly unknown and inconceivable....</p>







<h4>4.</h4>





<p>Ay, what is Dionysian?&mdash;In this book may be found an answer,&mdash;a

"knowing one" speaks here, the votary and disciple of his god.

Perhaps I should now speak more guardedly and less eloquently of a

psychological question so difficult as the origin of tragedy among the

Greeks. A fundamental question is the relation of the Greek to pain,

his degree of sensibility,&mdash;did this relation remain constant? or did

it veer about?&mdash;the question, whether his ever-increasing <i>longing

for beauty,</i> for festivals, gaieties, new cults, did really grow out

of want, privation, melancholy, pain? For suppose even this to be

true&mdash;and Pericles (or Thucydides) intimates as much in the great

Funeral Speech:&mdash;whence then the opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> longing, which appeared

first in the order of time, the <i>longing for the ugly</i>, the good,

resolute desire of the Old Hellene for pessimism, for tragic myth, for

the picture of all that is terrible, evil, enigmatical, destructive,

fatal at the basis of existence,&mdash;whence then must tragedy have

sprung? Perhaps from <i>joy,</i> from strength, from exuberant health, from

over-fullness. And what then, physiologically speaking, is the meaning

of that madness, out of which comic as well as tragic art has grown,

the Dionysian madness? What? perhaps madness is not necessarily the

symptom of degeneration, of decline, of belated culture? Perhaps there

are&mdash;a question for alienists&mdash;neuroses of <i>health</i>? of folk-youth

and youthfulness? What does that synthesis of god and goat in the

Satyr point to? What self-experience what "stress," made the Greek

think of the Dionysian reveller and primitive man as a satyr? And as

regards the origin of the tragic chorus: perhaps there were endemic

ecstasies in the eras when the Greek body bloomed and the Greek soul

brimmed over with life? Visions and hallucinations, which took hold

of entire communities, entire cult-assemblies? What if the Greeks

in the very wealth of their youth had the will <i>to be</i> tragic and

were pessimists? What if it was madness itself, to use a word of

Plato's, which brought the <i>greatest</i> blessings upon Hellas? And

what if, on the other hand and conversely, at the very time of their

dissolution and weakness, the Greeks became always more optimistic,

more superficial, more histrionic, also more ardent for logic and

the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> logicising of the world,&mdash;consequently at the same time more

"cheerful" and more "scientific"? Ay, despite all "modern ideas" and

prejudices of the democratic taste, may not the triumph of <i>optimism,</i>

the <i>common sense</i> that has gained the upper hand, the practical and

theoretical <i>utilitarianism,</i> like democracy itself, with which it is

synchronous&mdash;be symptomatic of declining vigour, of approaching age,

of physiological weariness? And <i>not</i> at all&mdash;pessimism? Was Epicurus

an optimist&mdash;because a <i>sufferer</i>?... We see it is a whole bundle of

weighty questions which this book has taken upon itself,&mdash;let us not

fail to add its weightiest question! Viewed through the optics of

<i>life,</i> what is the meaning of&mdash;morality?...</p>







<h4>5.</h4>





<p>Already in the foreword to Richard Wagner, art&mdash;-and <i>not</i> morality&mdash;is

set down as the properly <i>metaphysical</i> activity of man; in the

book itself the piquant proposition recurs time and again, that the

existence of the world is <i>justified</i> only as an æsthetic phenomenon.

Indeed, the entire book recognises only an artist-thought and

artist-after-thought behind all occurrences,&mdash;a "God," if you will,

but certainly only an altogether thoughtless and unmoral artist-God,

who, in construction as in destruction, in good as in evil, desires

to become conscious of his own equable joy and sovereign glory; who,

in creating worlds, frees himself from the <i>anguish</i> of fullness

and <i>overfullness,</i> from the <i>suffering</i> of the contradictions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>

concentrated within him. The world, that is, the redemption of God

<i>attained</i> at every moment, as the perpetually changing, perpetually

new vision of the most suffering, most antithetical, most contradictory

being, who contrives to redeem himself only in <i>appearance:</i> this

entire artist-metaphysics, call it arbitrary, idle, fantastic, if

you will,&mdash;the point is, that it already betrays a spirit, which is

determined some day, at all hazards, to make a stand against the

<i>moral</i> interpretation and significance of life. Here, perhaps for the

first time, a pessimism "Beyond Good and Evil" announces itself, here

that "perverseness of disposition" obtains expression and formulation,

against which Schopenhauer never grew tired of hurling beforehand his

angriest imprecations and thunderbolts,&mdash;a philosophy which dares to

put, derogatorily put, morality itself in the world of phenomena, and

not only among "phenomena" (in the sense of the idealistic <i>terminus

technicus</i>), but among the "illusions," as appearance, semblance,

error, interpretation, accommodation, art. Perhaps the depth of this

<i>antimoral</i> tendency may be best estimated from the guarded and

hostile silence with which Christianity is treated throughout this

book,&mdash;Christianity, as being the most extravagant burlesque of the

moral theme to which mankind has hitherto been obliged to listen. In

fact, to the purely æsthetic world-interpretation and justification

taught in this book, there is no greater antithesis than the Christian

dogma, which is <i>only</i> and will be only moral, and which, with

its absolute standards, for instance, its truthfulness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> of God,

relegates&mdash;that is, disowns, convicts, condemns&mdash;art, <i>all</i> art, to

the realm of <i>falsehood.</i> Behind such a mode of thought and valuation,

which, if at all genuine, must be hostile to art, I always experienced

what was <i>hostile to life,</i> the wrathful, vindictive counterwill to

life itself: for all life rests on appearance, art, illusion, optics,

necessity of perspective and error. From the very first Christianity

was, essentially and thoroughly, the nausea and surfeit of Life for

Life, which only disguised, concealed and decked itself out under the

belief in "another" or "better" life. The hatred of the "world," the

curse on the affections, the fear of beauty and sensuality, another

world, invented for the purpose of slandering this world the more,

at bottom a longing for. Nothingness, for the end, for rest, for the

"Sabbath of Sabbaths"&mdash;all this, as also the unconditional will of

Christianity to recognise <i>only</i> moral values, has always appeared to

me as the most dangerous and ominous of all possible forms of a "will

to perish"; at the least, as the symptom of a most fatal disease, of

profoundest weariness, despondency, exhaustion, impoverishment of

life,&mdash;for before the tribunal of morality (especially Christian, that

is, unconditional morality) life <i>must</i> constantly and inevitably be

the loser, because life <i>is</i> something essentially unmoral,&mdash;indeed,

oppressed with the weight of contempt and the everlasting No, life

<i>must</i> finally be regarded as unworthy of desire, as in itself

unworthy. Morality itself what?&mdash;may not morality be a "will to

disown life," a secret instinct for annihilation, a principle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> of

decay, of depreciation, of slander, a beginning of the end? And,

consequently, the danger of dangers?... It was <i>against</i> morality,

therefore, that my instinct, as an intercessory-instinct for life,

turned in this questionable book, inventing for itself a fundamental

counter&mdash;dogma and counter-valuation of life, purely artistic, purely

<i>anti-Christian.</i> What should I call it? As a philologist and man of

words I baptised it, not without some liberty&mdash;for who could be sure

of the proper name of the Antichrist?&mdash;with the name of a Greek god: I

called it <i>Dionysian.</i></p>







<h4>6.</h4>





<p>You see which problem I ventured to touch upon in this early work?...

How I now regret, that I had not then the courage (or immodesty?) to

allow myself, in all respects, the use of an <i>individual language</i>

for such <i>individual</i> contemplations and ventures in the field of

thought&mdash;that I laboured to express, in Kantian and Schopenhauerian

formulæ, strange and new valuations, which ran fundamentally counter

to the spirit of Kant and Schopenhauer, as well as to their taste!

What, forsooth, were Schopenhauer's views on tragedy? "What gives"&mdash;he

says in <i>Welt als Wille und Vorstellung,</i> II. 495&mdash;"to all tragedy

that singular swing towards elevation, is the awakening of the

knowledge that the world, that life, cannot satisfy us thoroughly,

and consequently is <i>not worthy</i> of our attachment In this consists

the tragic spirit: it therefore leads to <i>resignation</i>." Oh, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>

differently Dionysos spoke to me! Oh how far from me then was just

this entire resignationism!&mdash;But there is something far worse in this

book, which I now regret even more than having obscured and spoiled

Dionysian anticipations with Schopenhauerian formulæ: to wit, that, in

general, I <i>spoiled</i> the grand <i>Hellenic problem,</i> as it had opened

up before me, by the admixture of the most modern things! That I

entertained hopes, where nothing was to be hoped for, where everything

pointed all-too-clearly to an approaching end! That, on the basis of

our latter-day German music, I began to fable about the "spirit of

Teutonism," as if it were on the point of discovering and returning

to itself,&mdash;ay, at the very time that the German spirit which not so

very long before had had the will to the lordship over Europe, the

strength to lead and govern Europe, testamentarily and conclusively

<i>resigned</i> and, under the pompous pretence of empire-founding,

effected its transition to mediocritisation, democracy, and "modern

ideas." In very fact, I have since learned to regard this "spirit of

Teutonism" as something to be despaired of and unsparingly treated,

as also our present <i>German music,</i> which is Romanticism through and

through and the most un-Grecian of all possible forms of art: and

moreover a first-rate nerve-destroyer, doubly dangerous for a people

given to drinking and revering the unclear as a virtue, namely, in

its twofold capacity of an intoxicating and stupefying narcotic. Of

course, apart from all precipitate hopes and faulty applications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> to

matters specially modern, with which I then spoiled my first book, the

great Dionysian note of interrogation, as set down therein, continues

standing on and on, even with reference to music: how must we conceive

of a music, which is no longer of Romantic origin, like the German; but

of <i>Dionysian</i>?...</p>







<h4>7.</h4>





<p>&mdash;But, my dear Sir, if <i>your</i> book is not Romanticism, what in

the world is? Can the deep hatred of the present, of "reality"

and "modern ideas" be pushed farther than has been done in your

artist-metaphysics?&mdash;which would rather believe in Nothing, or in

the devil, than in the "Now"? Does not a radical bass of wrath and

annihilative pleasure growl on beneath all your contrapuntal vocal

art and aural seduction, a mad determination to oppose all that "now"

is, a will which is not so very far removed from practical nihilism

and which seems to say: "rather let nothing be true, than that <i>you</i>

should be in the right, than that <i>your</i> truth should prevail!"

Hear, yourself, my dear Sir Pessimist and art-deifier, with ever

so unlocked ears, a single select passage of your own book, that

not ineloquent dragon-slayer passage, which may sound insidiously

rat-charming to young ears and hearts. What? is not that the true

blue romanticist-confession of 1830 under the mask of the pessimism

of 1850? After which, of course, the usual romanticist finale at once

strikes up,&mdash;rupture, collapse, return and prostration before an old

belief, before <i>the</i> old God....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> What? is not your pessimist book

itself a piece of anti-Hellenism and Romanticism, something "equally

intoxicating and befogging," a narcotic at all events, ay, a piece of

music, of <i>German</i> music? But listen:</p>



<blockquote>



<p>Let us imagine a rising generation with this undauntedness

of vision, with this heroic impulse towards the prodigious,

let us imagine the bold step of these dragon-slayers,

the proud daring with which they turn their backs on all

the effeminate doctrines of optimism, in order "to live

resolutely" in the Whole and in the Full: <i>would it not be

necessary</i> for the tragic man of this culture, with his

self-discipline to earnestness and terror, to desire a new

art, <i>the art of metaphysical comfort,</i> tragedy as the

Helena belonging to him, and that he should exclaim with

Faust:</p>



<p style="margin-left: 10%;">

"Und sollt ich nicht, sehnsüchtigster Gewalt,<br />

In's Leben ziehn die einzigste Gestalt?"<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><br />

</p>

</blockquote>



<p>"Would it not be <i>necessary</i>?" ... No, thrice no! ye young

romanticists: it would <i>not</i> be necessary! But it is very probable,

that things may <i>end</i> thus, that <i>ye</i> may end thus, namely "comforted,"

as it is written, in spite of all self-discipline to earnestness and

terror; metaphysically comforted, in short, as Romanticists are wont to

end, as <i>Christians....</i> No! ye should first of all learn the art of

earthly comfort, ye should learn to <i>laugh,</i> my young friends, if ye

are at all determined to remain pessimists: if so, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> will perhaps,

as laughing ones, eventually send all metaphysical comfortism to the

devil&mdash;and metaphysics first of all! Or, to say it in the language of

that Dionysian ogre, called <i>Zarathustra</i>:</p>



<blockquote>



<p>"Lift up your hearts, my brethren, high, higher! And do

not forget your legs! Lift up also your legs, ye good

dancers&mdash;and better still if ye stand also on your heads!</p>



<p>"This crown of the laughter, this rose-garland crown&mdash;I

myself have put on this crown; I myself have consecrated my

laughter. No one else have I found to-day strong enough for

this.</p>



<p>"Zarathustra the dancer, Zarathustra the light one,

who beckoneth with his pinions, one ready for flight,

beckoning unto all birds, ready and prepared, a blissfully

light-spirited one:&mdash;</p>



<p>"Zarathustra the soothsayer, Zarathustra the sooth-laugher,

no impatient one, no absolute one, one who loveth leaps and

side-leaps: I myself have put on this crown!</p>



<p>"This crown of the laughter, this rose-garland crown&mdash;to

you my brethren do I cast this crown! Laughing have I

consecrated: ye higher men, <i>learn,</i> I pray you&mdash;to laugh!"</p>



<p><i>Thus spake Zarathustra</i>, lxxiii. 17, 18, and 20.</p></blockquote>

<p>In order to keep at a distance all the possible scruples, excitements,

and misunderstandings to which the thoughts gathered in this essay

will give occasion, considering the peculiar character of our æsthetic

publicity, and to be able also Co write the introductory remarks

with the same contemplative delight, the impress of which, as the

petrifaction of good and elevating hours, it bears on every page, I

form a conception of the moment when you, my highly honoured friend,

will receive this essay; how you, say after an evening walk in the

winter snow, will behold the unbound Prometheus on the title-page,

read my name, and be forthwith convinced that, whatever this essay may

contain, the author has something earnest and impressive to say, and,

moreover, that in all his meditations he communed with you as with one

present and could thus write only what befitted your presence. You

will thus remember that it was at the same time as your magnificent

dissertation on Beethoven originated, viz., amidst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> the horrors and

sublimities of the war which had just then broken out, that I collected

myself for these thoughts. But those persons would err, to whom this

collection suggests no more perhaps than the antithesis of patriotic

excitement and æsthetic revelry, of gallant earnestness and sportive

delight. Upon a real perusal of this essay, such readers will, rather

to their surprise, discover how earnest is the German problem we have

to deal with, which we properly place, as a vortex and turning-point,

in the very midst of German hopes. Perhaps, however, this same class

of readers will be shocked at seeing an æsthetic problem taken so

seriously, especially if they can recognise in art no more than a merry

diversion, a readily dispensable court-jester to the "earnestness

of existence": as if no one were aware of the real meaning of this

confrontation with the "earnestness of existence." These earnest ones

may be informed that I am convinced that art is the highest task and

the properly metaphysical activity of this life, as it is understood by

the man, to whom, as my sublime protagonist on this path, I would now

dedicate this essay.</p>

<h3><a name="THE_BIRTH_OF_TRAGEDY" id="THE_BIRTH_OF_TRAGEDY">THE BIRTH OF TRAGEDY.</a></h3>







<h4>1.</h4>





<p>We shall have gained much for the science of æsthetics, when once we

have perceived not only by logical inference, but by the immediate

certainty of intuition, that the continuous development of art is bound

up with the duplexity of the <i>Apollonian</i> and the <i>Dionysian:</i> in

like manner as procreation is dependent on the duality of the sexes,

involving perpetual conflicts with only periodically intervening

reconciliations. These names we borrow from the Greeks, who disclose

to the intelligent observer the profound mysteries of their view of

art, not indeed in concepts, but in the impressively clear figures of

their world of deities. It is in connection with Apollo and Dionysus,

the two art-deities of the Greeks, that we learn that there existed in

the Grecian world a wide antithesis, in origin and aims, between the

art of the shaper, the Apollonian, and the non-plastic art of music,

that of Dionysus: both these so heterogeneous tendencies run parallel

to each other, for the most part openly at variance, and continually

inciting each other to new and more powerful births, to perpetuate in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>

them the strife of this antithesis, which is but seemingly bridged over

by their mutual term "Art"; till at last, by a metaphysical miracle

of the Hellenic will, they appear paired with each other, and through

this pairing eventually generate the equally Dionysian and Apollonian

art-work of Attic tragedy.</p>



<p>In order to bring these two tendencies within closer range, let us

conceive them first of all as the separate art-worlds of <i>dreamland</i>

and <i>drunkenness;</i> between which physiological phenomena a contrast

may be observed analogous to that existing between the Apollonian and

the Dionysian. In dreams, according to the conception of Lucretius,

the glorious divine figures first appeared to the souls of men, in

dreams the great shaper beheld the charming corporeal structure of

superhuman beings, and the Hellenic poet, if consulted on the mysteries

of poetic inspiration, would likewise have suggested dreams and would

have offered an explanation resembling that of Hans Sachs in the

Meistersingers:&mdash;</p>



<p style="margin-left: 10%;">

Mein Freund, das grad' ist Dichters Werk,<br />

dass er sein Träumen deut' und merk'.<br />

Glaubt mir, des Menschen wahrster Wahn<br />

wird ihm im Traume aufgethan:<br />

all' Dichtkunst und Poeterei<br />

ist nichts als Wahrtraum-Deuterei.<a name="FNanchor_1_3" id="FNanchor_1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_3" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><br />

</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>





<p>The beauteous appearance of the dream-worlds, in the production of

which every man is a perfect artist, is the presupposition of all

plastic art, and in fact, as we shall see, of an important half of

poetry also. We take delight in the immediate apprehension of form; all

forms speak to us; there is nothing indifferent, nothing superfluous.

But, together with the highest life of this dream-reality we also have,

glimmering through it, the sensation of its appearance: such at least

is my experience, as to the frequency, ay, normality of which I could

adduce many proofs, as also the sayings of the poets. Indeed, the man

of philosophic turn has a foreboding that underneath this reality in

which we live and have our being, another and altogether different

reality lies concealed, and that therefore it is also an appearance;

and Schopenhauer actually designates the gift of occasionally regarding

men and things as mere phantoms and dream-pictures as the criterion of

philosophical ability. Accordingly, the man susceptible to art stands

in the same relation to the reality of dreams as the philosopher to

the reality of existence; he is a close and willing observer, for from

these pictures he reads the meaning of life, and by these processes

he trains himself for life. And it is perhaps not only the agreeable

and friendly pictures that he realises in himself with such perfect

understanding: the earnest, the troubled, the dreary, the gloomy, the

sudden checks, the tricks of fortune, the uneasy presentiments, in

short, the whole "Divine Comedy" of life, and the Inferno, also pass

before him, not merely like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> pictures on the wall&mdash;for he too lives and

suffers in these scenes,&mdash;and yet not without that fleeting sensation

of appearance. And perhaps many a one will, like myself, recollect

having sometimes called out cheeringly and not without success amid the

dangers and terrors of dream-life: "It is a dream! I will dream on!" I

have likewise been told of persons capable of continuing the causality

of one and the same dream for three and even more successive nights:

all of which facts clearly testify that our innermost being, the common

substratum of all of us, experiences our dreams with deep joy and

cheerful acquiescence.</p>



<p>This cheerful acquiescence in the dream-experience has likewise been

embodied by the Greeks in their Apollo: for Apollo, as the god of

all shaping energies, is also the soothsaying god. He, who (as the

etymology of the name indicates) is the "shining one," the deity of

light, also rules over the fair appearance of the inner world of

fantasies. The higher truth, the perfection of these states in contrast

to the only partially intelligible everyday world, ay, the deep

consciousness of nature, healing and helping in sleep and dream, is at

the same time the symbolical analogue of the faculty of soothsaying

and, in general, of the arts, through which life is made possible and

worth living. But also that delicate line, which the dream-picture must

not overstep&mdash;lest it act pathologically (in which case appearance,

being reality pure and simple, would impose upon us)&mdash;must not be

wanting in the picture of Apollo: that measured limitation, that

freedom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> from the wilder emotions, that philosophical calmness of the

sculptor-god. His eye must be "sunlike," according to his origin; even

when it is angry and looks displeased, the sacredness of his beauteous

appearance is still there. And so we might apply to Apollo, in an

eccentric sense, what Schopenhauer says of the man wrapt in the veil

of Mâyâ<a name="FNanchor_2_4" id="FNanchor_2_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_4" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>: <i>Welt als Wille und Vorstellung,</i> I. p. 416: "Just as in

a stormy sea, unbounded in every direction, rising and falling with

howling mountainous waves, a sailor sits in a boat and trusts in his

frail barque: so in the midst of a world of sorrows the individual sits

quietly supported by and trusting in his <i>principium individuationis</i>."

Indeed, we might say of Apollo, that in him the unshaken faith in

this <i>principium</i> and the quiet sitting of the man wrapt therein have

received their sublimest expression; and we might even designate Apollo

as the glorious divine image of the <i>principium individuationis,</i>

from out of the gestures and looks of which all the joy and wisdom of

"appearance," together with its beauty, speak to us.</p>



<p>In the same work Schopenhauer has described to us the stupendous <i>awe</i>

which seizes upon man, when of a sudden he is at a loss to account for

the cognitive forms of a phenomenon, in that the principle of reason,

in some one of its manifestations, seems to admit of an exception.

Add to this awe the blissful ecstasy which rises from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> innermost

depths of man, ay, of nature, at this same collapse of the <i>principium

individuationis,</i> and we shall gain an insight into the being of

the <i>Dionysian,</i> which is brought within closest ken perhaps by the

analogy of <i>drunkenness.</i> It is either under the influence of the

narcotic draught, of which the hymns of all primitive men and peoples

tell us, or by the powerful approach of spring penetrating all nature

with joy, that those Dionysian emotions awake, in the augmentation of

which the subjective vanishes to complete self-forgetfulness. So also

in the German Middle Ages singing and dancing crowds, ever increasing

in number, were borne from place to place under this same Dionysian

power. In these St. John's and St. Vitus's dancers we again perceive

the Bacchic choruses of the Greeks, with their previous history in Asia

Minor, as far back as Babylon and the orgiastic Sacæa. There are some,

who, from lack of experience or obtuseness, will turn away from such

phenomena as "folk-diseases" with a smile of contempt or pity prompted

by the consciousness of their own health: of course, the poor wretches

do not divine what a cadaverous-looking and ghastly aspect this very

"health" of theirs presents when the glowing life of the Dionysian

revellers rushes past them.</p>



<p>Under the charm of the Dionysian not only is the covenant between man

and man again established, but also estranged, hostile or subjugated

nature again celebrates her reconciliation with her lost son, man. Of

her own accord earth proffers her gifts, and peacefully the beasts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>

prey approach from the desert and the rocks. The chariot of Dionysus is

bedecked with flowers and garlands: panthers and tigers pass beneath

his yoke. Change Beethoven's "jubilee-song" into a painting, and, if

your imagination be equal to the occasion when the awestruck millions

sink into the dust, you will then be able to approach the Dionysian.

Now is the slave a free man, now all the stubborn, hostile barriers,

which necessity, caprice, or "shameless fashion" has set up between

man and man, are broken down. Now, at the evangel of cosmic harmony,

each one feels himself not only united, reconciled, blended with

his neighbour, but as one with him, as if the veil of Mâyâ has been

torn and were now merely fluttering in tatters before the mysterious

Primordial Unity. In song and in dance man exhibits himself as a member

of a higher community, he has forgotten how to walk and speak, and

is on the point of taking a dancing flight into the air. His gestures

bespeak enchantment. Even as the animals now talk, and as the earth

yields milk and honey, so also something super-natural sounds forth

from him: he feels himself a god, he himself now walks about enchanted

and elated even as the gods whom he saw walking about in his dreams.

Man is no longer an artist, he has become a work of art: the artistic

power of all nature here reveals itself in the tremors of drunkenness

to the highest gratification of the Primordial Unity. The noblest clay,

the costliest marble, namely man, is here kneaded and cut, and the

chisel strokes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> the Dionysian world-artist are accompanied with the

cry of the Eleusinian mysteries: "Ihr stürzt nieder, Millionen? Ahnest

du den Schöpfer, Welt?"<a name="FNanchor_3_5" id="FNanchor_3_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_5" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<h4>2.</h4>





<p>Thus far we have considered the Apollonian and his antithesis,

the Dionysian, as artistic powers, which burst forth from nature

herself, <i>without the mediation of the human artist,</i> and in which

her art-impulses are satisfied in the most immediate and direct way:

first, as the pictorial world of dreams, the perfection of which

has no connection whatever with the intellectual height or artistic

culture of the unit man, and again, as drunken reality, which likewise

does not heed the unit man, but even seeks to destroy the individual

and redeem him by a mystic feeling of Oneness. Anent these immediate

art-states of nature every artist is either an "imitator," to wit,

either an Apollonian, an artist in dreams, or a Dionysian, an artist

in ecstasies, or finally&mdash;as for instance in Greek tragedy&mdash;an artist

in both dreams and ecstasies: so we may perhaps picture him, as in

his Dionysian drunkenness and mystical self-abnegation, lonesome and

apart from the revelling choruses, he sinks down, and how now, through

Apollonian dream-inspiration, his own state, <i>i.e.</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> his oneness

with the primal source of the universe, reveals itself to him <i>in a

symbolical dream-picture</i>.</p>



<p>After these general premisings and contrastings, let us now approach

the <i>Greeks</i> in order to learn in what degree and to what height

these <i>art-impulses of nature</i> were developed in them: whereby

we shall be enabled to understand and appreciate more deeply the

relation of the Greek artist to his archetypes, or, according to the

Aristotelian expression, "the imitation of nature." In spite of all the

dream-literature and the numerous dream-anecdotes of the Greeks, we can

speak only conjecturally, though with a fair degree of certainty, of

their <i>dreams.</i> Considering the incredibly precise and unerring plastic

power of their eyes, as also their manifest and sincere delight in

colours, we can hardly refrain (to the shame of every one born later)

from assuming for their very dreams a logical causality of lines and

contours, colours and groups, a sequence of scenes resembling their

best reliefs, the perfection of which would certainly justify us, if a

comparison were possible, in designating the dreaming Greeks as Homers

and Homer as a dreaming Greek: in a deeper sense than when modern man,

in respect to his dreams, ventures to compare himself with Shakespeare.</p>



<p>On the other hand, we should not have to speak conjecturally, if asked

to disclose the immense gap which separated the <i>Dionysian Greek</i> from

the Dionysian barbarian. From all quarters of the Ancient World&mdash;to

say nothing of the modern&mdash;from Rome as far as Babylon, we can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> prove

the existence of Dionysian festivals, the type of which bears, at

best, the same relation to the Greek festivals as the bearded satyr,

who borrowed his name and attributes from the goat, does to Dionysus

himself. In nearly every instance the centre of these festivals lay

in extravagant sexual licentiousness, the waves of which overwhelmed

all family life and its venerable traditions; the very wildest beasts

of nature were let loose here, including that detestable mixture of

lust and cruelty which has always seemed to me the genuine "witches'

draught." For some time, however, it would seem that the Greeks

were perfectly secure and guarded against the feverish agitations

of these festivals (&mdash;the knowledge of which entered Greece by all

the channels of land and sea) by the figure of Apollo himself rising

here in full pride, who could not have held out the Gorgon's head to

a more dangerous power than this grotesquely uncouth Dionysian. It

is in Doric art that this majestically-rejecting attitude of Apollo

perpetuated itself. This opposition became more precarious and even

impossible, when, from out of the deepest root of the Hellenic nature,

similar impulses finally broke forth and made way for themselves:

the Delphic god, by a seasonably effected reconciliation, was now

contented with taking the destructive arms from the hands of his

powerful antagonist. This reconciliation marks the most important

moment in the history of the Greek cult: wherever we turn our eyes

we may observe the revolutions resulting from this event. It was

the reconciliation of two antagonists,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> with the sharp demarcation

of the boundary-lines to be thenceforth observed by each, and with

periodical transmission of testimonials;&mdash;in reality, the chasm was

not bridged over. But if we observe how, under the pressure of this

conclusion of peace, the Dionysian power manifested itself, we shall

now recognise in the Dionysian orgies of the Greeks, as compared with

the Babylonian Sacæa and their retrogression of man to the tiger and

the ape, the significance of festivals of world-redemption and days of

transfiguration. Not till then does nature attain her artistic jubilee;

not till then does the rupture of the <i>principium individuationis</i>

become an artistic phenomenon. That horrible "witches' draught" of

sensuality and cruelty was here powerless: only the curious blending

and duality in the emotions of the Dionysian revellers reminds one of

it&mdash;just as medicines remind one of deadly poisons,&mdash;that phenomenon,

to wit, that pains beget joy, that jubilation wrings painful sounds out

of the breast. From the highest joy sounds the cry of horror or the

yearning wail over an irretrievable loss. In these Greek festivals a

sentimental trait, as it were, breaks forth from nature, as if she must

sigh over her dismemberment into individuals. The song and pantomime

of such dually-minded revellers was something new and unheard-of in

the Homeric-Grecian world; and the Dionysian <i>music</i> in particular

excited awe and horror. If music, as it would seem, was previously

known as an Apollonian art, it was, strictly speaking, only as the

wave-beat of rhythm, the formative power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> which was developed to

the representation of Apollonian conditions. The music of Apollo was

Doric architectonics in tones, but in merely suggested tones, such

as those of the cithara. The very element which forms the essence of

Dionysian music (and hence of music in general) is carefully excluded

as un-Apollonian; namely, the thrilling power of the tone, the uniform

stream of the melos, and the thoroughly incomparable world of harmony.

In the Dionysian dithyramb man is incited to the highest exaltation

of all his symbolic faculties; something never before experienced

struggles for utterance&mdash;the annihilation of the veil of Mâyâ, Oneness

as genius of the race, ay, of nature. The essence of nature is now

to be expressed symbolically; a new world of symbols is required;

for once the entire symbolism of the body, not only the symbolism of

the lips, face, and speech, but the whole pantomime of dancing which

sets all the members into rhythmical motion. Thereupon the other

symbolic powers, those of music, in rhythmics, dynamics, and harmony,

suddenly become impetuous. To comprehend this collective discharge

of all the symbolic powers, a man must have already attained that

height of self-abnegation, which wills to express itself symbolically

through these powers: the Dithyrambic votary of Dionysus is therefore

understood only by those like himself! With what astonishment must the

Apollonian Greek have beheld him! With an astonishment, which was all

the greater the more it was mingled with the shuddering suspicion that

all this was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> reality not so very foreign to him, yea, that, like

unto a veil, his Apollonian consciousness only hid this Dionysian world

from his view.</p>







<h4>3.</h4>





<p>In order to comprehend this, we must take down the artistic structure

of the <i>Apollonian culture,</i> as it were, stone by stone, till we behold

the foundations on which it rests. Here we observe first of all the

glorious <i>Olympian</i> figures of the gods, standing on the gables of this

structure, whose deeds, represented in far-shining reliefs, adorn its

friezes. Though Apollo stands among them as an individual deity, side

by side with others, and without claim to priority of rank, we must not

suffer this fact to mislead us. The same impulse which embodied itself

in Apollo has, in general, given birth to this whole Olympian world,

and in this sense we may regard Apollo as the father thereof. What was

the enormous need from which proceeded such an illustrious group of

Olympian beings?</p>



<p>Whosoever, with another religion in his heart, approaches these

Olympians and seeks among them for moral elevation, even for sanctity,

for incorporeal spiritualisation, for sympathetic looks of love, will

soon be obliged to turn his back on them, discouraged and disappointed.

Here nothing suggests asceticism, spirituality, or duty: here only

an exuberant, even triumphant life speaks to us, in which everything

existing is deified, whether good or bad. And so the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> spectator will

perhaps stand quite bewildered before this fantastic exuberance of

life, and ask himself what magic potion these madly merry men could

have used for enjoying life, so that, wherever they turned their eyes,

Helena, the ideal image of their own existence "floating in sweet

sensuality," smiled upon them. But to this spectator, already turning

backwards, we must call out: "depart not hence, but hear rather what

Greek folk-wisdom says of this same life, which with such inexplicable

cheerfulness spreads out before thee." There is an ancient story that

king Midas hunted in the forest a long time for the wise <i>Silenus,</i>

the companion of Dionysus, without capturing him. When at last he fell

into his hands, the king asked what was best of all and most desirable

for man. Fixed and immovable, the demon remained silent; till at last,

forced by the king, he broke out with shrill laughter into these words:

"Oh, wretched race of a day, children of chance and misery, why do ye

compel me to say to you what it were most expedient for you not to

hear? What is best of all is for ever beyond your reach: not to be

born, not to <i>be</i>, to be <i>nothing.</i> The second best for you, however,

is soon to die."</p>



<p>How is the Olympian world of deities related to this folk-wisdom? Even

as the rapturous vision of the tortured martyr to his sufferings.</p>



<p>Now the Olympian magic mountain opens, as it were, to our view and

shows to us its roots. The Greek knew and felt the terrors and horrors

of existence: to be able to live at all, he had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> interpose the

shining dream-birth of the Olympian world between himself and them.

The excessive distrust of the titanic powers of nature, the Moira

throning inexorably over all knowledge, the vulture of the great

philanthropist Prometheus, the terrible fate of the wise Œdipus, the

family curse of the Atridæ which drove Orestes to matricide; in short,

that entire philosophy of the sylvan god, with its mythical exemplars,

which wrought the ruin of the melancholy Etruscans&mdash;was again and again

surmounted anew by the Greeks through the artistic <i>middle world</i> of

the Olympians, or at least veiled and withdrawn from sight. To be able

to live, the Greeks had, from direst necessity, to create these gods:

which process we may perhaps picture to ourselves in this manner: that

out of the original Titan thearchy of terror the Olympian thearchy of

joy was evolved, by slow transitions, through the Apollonian impulse to

beauty, even as roses break forth from thorny bushes. How else could

this so sensitive people, so vehement in its desires, so singularly

qualified for <i>sufferings</i> have endured existence, if it had not been

exhibited to them in their gods, surrounded with a higher glory?

The same impulse which calls art into being, as the complement and

consummation of existence, seducing to a continuation of life, caused

also the Olympian world to arise, in which the Hellenic "will" held

up before itself a transfiguring mirror. Thus do the gods justify the

life of man, in that they themselves live it&mdash;the only satisfactory

Theodicy! Existence under the bright sunshine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> of such gods is regarded

as that which is desirable in itself, and the real <i>grief</i> of the

Homeric men has reference to parting from it, especially to early

parting: so that we might now say of them, with a reversion of the

Silenian wisdom, that "to die early is worst of all for them, the

second worst is&mdash;some day to die at all." If once the lamentation is

heard, it will ring out again, of the short-lived Achilles, of the

leaf-like change and vicissitude of the human race, of the decay of

the heroic age. It is not unworthy of the greatest hero to long for a

continuation of life, ay, even as a day-labourer. So vehemently does

the "will," at the Apollonian stage of development, long for this

existence, so completely at one does the Homeric man feel himself with

it, that the very lamentation becomes its song of praise.</p>



<p>Here we must observe that this harmony which is so eagerly contemplated

by modern man, in fact, this oneness of man with nature, to express

which Schiller introduced the technical term "naïve," is by no means

such a simple, naturally resulting and, as it were, inevitable

condition, which <i>must</i> be found at the gate of every culture leading

to a paradise of man: this could be believed only by an age which

sought to picture to itself Rousseau's Émile also as an artist,

and imagined it had found in Homer such an artist Émile, reared at

Nature's bosom. Wherever we meet with the "naïve" in art, it behoves

us to recognise the highest effect of the Apollonian culture, which

in the first place has always to overthrow some Titanic empire and

slay monsters, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> which, through powerful dazzling representations

and pleasurable illusions, must have triumphed over a terrible depth

of world-contemplation and a most keen susceptibility to suffering.

But how seldom is the naïve&mdash;that complete absorption, in the beauty

of appearance&mdash;attained! And hence how inexpressibly sublime is

<i>Homer,</i> who, as unit being, bears the same relation to this Apollonian

folk-culture as the unit dream-artist does to the dream-faculty of

the people and of Nature in general. The Homeric "naïveté" can be

comprehended only as the complete triumph of the Apollonian illusion:

it is the same kind of illusion as Nature so frequently employs to

compass her ends. The true goal is veiled by a phantasm: we stretch out

our hands for the latter, while Nature attains the former through our

illusion. In the Greeks the "will" desired to contemplate itself in the

transfiguration of the genius and the world of art; in order to glorify

themselves, its creatures had to feel themselves worthy of glory;

they had to behold themselves again in a higher sphere, without this

consummate world of contemplation acting as an imperative or reproach.

Such is the sphere of beauty, in which, as in a mirror, they saw their

images, the Olympians. With this mirroring of beauty the Hellenic will

combated its talent&mdash;correlative to the artistic&mdash;for suffering and for

the wisdom of suffering: and, as a monument of its victory, Homer, the

naïve artist, stands before us.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>







<h4>4.</h4>





<p>Concerning this naïve artist the analogy of dreams will enlighten us to

some extent. When we realise to ourselves the dreamer, as, in the midst

of the illusion of the dream-world and without disturbing it, he calls

out to himself: "it is a dream, I will dream on"; when we must thence

infer a deep inner joy in dream-contemplation; when, on the other hand,

to be at all able to dream with this inner joy in contemplation, we

must have completely forgotten the day and its terrible obtrusiveness,

we may, under the direction of the dream-reading Apollo, interpret

all these phenomena to ourselves somewhat as follows. Though it is

certain that of the two halves of life, the waking and the dreaming,

the former appeals to us as by far the more preferred, important,

excellent and worthy of being lived, indeed, as that which alone is

lived: yet, with reference to that mysterious ground of our being of

which we are the phenomenon, I should, paradoxical as it may seem, be

inclined to maintain the very opposite estimate of the value of dream

life. For the more clearly I perceive in nature those all-powerful art

impulses, and in them a fervent longing for appearance, for redemption

through appearance, the more I feel myself driven to the metaphysical

assumption that the Verily-Existent and Primordial Unity, as the

Eternally Suffering and Self-Contradictory, requires the rapturous

vision, the joyful appearance, for its continuous salvation: which

appearance we, who are completely wrapt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> in it and composed of it, must

regard as the Verily Non-existent,&mdash;<i>i.e.,</i> as a perpetual unfolding

in time, space and causality,&mdash;in other words, as empiric reality.

If we therefore waive the consideration of our own "reality" for the

present, if we conceive our empiric existence, and that of the world

generally, as a representation of the Primordial Unity generated every

moment, we shall then have to regard the dream as an <i>appearance of

appearance,</i> hence as a still higher gratification of the primordial

desire for appearance. It is for this same reason that the innermost

heart of Nature experiences that indescribable joy in the naïve artist

and in the naïve work of art, which is likewise only "an appearance of

appearance." In a symbolic painting, <i>Raphael</i>, himself one of these

immortal "naïve" ones, has represented to us this depotentiating of

appearance to appearance, the primordial process of the naïve artist

and at the same time of Apollonian culture. In his <i>Transfiguration,</i>

the lower half, with the possessed boy, the despairing bearers, the

helpless, terrified disciples, shows to us the reflection of eternal

primordial pain, the sole basis of the world: the "appearance" here

is the counter-appearance of eternal Contradiction, the father of

things. Out of this appearance then arises, like an ambrosial vapour, a

visionlike new world of appearances, of which those wrapt in the first

appearance see nothing&mdash;a radiant floating in purest bliss and painless

Contemplation beaming from wide-open eyes. Here there is presented to

our view, in the highest symbolism of art, that Apollonian world of

beauty and its substratum,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> the terrible wisdom of Silenus, and we

comprehend, by intuition, their necessary interdependence. Apollo,

however, again appears to us as the apotheosis of the <i>principium

individuationis,</i> in which alone the perpetually attained end of the

Primordial Unity, its redemption through appearance, is consummated: he

shows us, with sublime attitudes, how the entire world of torment is

necessary, that thereby the individual may be impelled to realise the

redeeming vision, and then, sunk in contemplation thereof, quietly sit

in his fluctuating barque, in the midst of the sea.</p>



<p>This apotheosis of individuation, if it be at all conceived as

imperative and laying down precepts, knows but one law&mdash;the individual,

<i>i.e.,</i> the observance of the boundaries of the individual,

<i>measure</i> in the Hellenic sense. Apollo, as ethical deity, demands

due proportion of his disciples, and, that this may be observed, he

demands self-knowledge. And thus, parallel to the æsthetic necessity

for beauty, there run the demands "know thyself" and "not too much,"

while presumption and undueness are regarded as the truly hostile

demons of the non-Apollonian sphere, hence as characteristics of the

pre-Apollonian age, that of the Titans, and of the extra-Apollonian

world, that of the barbarians. Because of his Titan-like love for

man, Prometheus had to be torn to pieces by vultures; because of his

excessive wisdom, which solved the riddle of the Sphinx, Œdipus had

to plunge into a bewildering vortex of monstrous crimes: thus did the

Delphic god interpret the Grecian past.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>



<p>So also the effects wrought by the <i>Dionysian</i> appeared "titanic" and

"barbaric" to the Apollonian Greek: while at the same time he could

not conceal from himself that he too was inwardly related to these

overthrown Titans and heroes. Indeed, he had to recognise still more

than this: his entire existence, with all its beauty and moderation,

rested on a hidden substratum of suffering and of knowledge, which

was again disclosed to him by the Dionysian. And lo! Apollo could not

live without Dionysus! The "titanic" and the "barbaric" were in the

end not less necessary than the Apollonian. And now let us imagine to

ourselves how the ecstatic tone of the Dionysian festival sounded in

ever more luring and bewitching strains into this artificially confined

world built on appearance and moderation, how in these strains all

the <i>undueness</i> of nature, in joy, sorrow, and knowledge, even to

the transpiercing shriek, became audible: let us ask ourselves what

meaning could be attached to the psalmodising artist of Apollo, with

the phantom harp-sound, as compared with this demonic folk-song! The

muses of the arts of "appearance" paled before an art which, in its

intoxication, spoke the truth, the wisdom of Silenus cried "woe! woe!"

against the cheerful Olympians. The individual, with all his boundaries

and due proportions, went under in the self-oblivion of the Dionysian

states and forgot the Apollonian precepts. The <i>Undueness</i> revealed

itself as truth, contradiction, the bliss born of pain, declared itself

but of the heart of nature. And thus, wherever the Dionysian prevailed,

the Apollonian was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> routed and annihilated. But it is quite as certain

that, where the first assault was successfully withstood, the authority

and majesty of the Delphic god exhibited itself as more rigid and

menacing than ever. For I can only explain to myself the <i>Doric</i> state

and Doric art as a permanent war-camp of the Apollonian: only by

incessant opposition to the titanic-barbaric nature of the Dionysian

was it possible for an art so defiantly-prim, so encompassed with

bulwarks, a training so warlike and rigorous, a constitution so cruel

and relentless, to last for any length of time.</p>



<p>Up to this point we have enlarged upon the observation made at the

beginning of this essay: how the Dionysian and the Apollonian, in ever

new births succeeding and mutually augmenting one another, controlled

the Hellenic genius: how from out the age of "bronze," with its Titan

struggles and rigorous folk-philosophy, the Homeric world develops

under the fostering sway of the Apollonian impulse to beauty, how this

"naïve" splendour is again overwhelmed by the inbursting flood of the

Dionysian, and how against this new power the Apollonian rises to the

austere majesty of Doric art and the Doric view of things. If, then,

in this way, in the strife of these two hostile principles, the older

Hellenic history falls into four great periods of art, we are now

driven to inquire after the ulterior purpose of these unfoldings and

processes, unless perchance we should regard the last-attained period,

the period of Doric art, as the end and aim of these artistic impulses:

and here the sublime and highly celebrated art-work of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> <i>Attic tragedy</i>

and dramatic dithyramb presents itself to our view as the common

goal of both these impulses, whose mysterious union, after many and

long precursory struggles, found its glorious consummation in such a

child,&mdash;which is at once Antigone and Cassandra.</p>







<h4>5.</h4>





<p>We now approach the real purpose of our investigation, which aims

at acquiring a knowledge of the Dionyso-Apollonian genius and his

art-work, or at least an anticipatory understanding of the mystery of

the aforesaid union. Here we shall ask first of all where that new

germ which subsequently developed into tragedy and dramatic dithyramb

first makes itself perceptible in the Hellenic world. The ancients

themselves supply the answer in symbolic form, when they place <i>Homer</i>

and <i>Archilochus</i> as the forefathers and torch-bearers of Greek poetry

side by side on gems, sculptures, etc., in the sure conviction that

only these two thoroughly original compeers, from whom a stream of

fire flows over the whole of Greek posterity, should be taken into

consideration. Homer, the aged dreamer sunk in himself, the type

of the Apollonian naïve artist, beholds now with astonishment the

impassioned genius of the warlike votary of the muses, Archilochus,

violently tossed to and fro on the billows of existence: and modern

æsthetics could only add by way of interpretation, that here the

"objective" artist is confronted by the first "subjective" artist.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>

But this interpretation is of little service to us, because we know

the subjective artist only as the poor artist, and in every type and

elevation of art we demand specially and first of all the conquest

of the Subjective, the redemption from the "ego" and the cessation

of every individual will and desire; indeed, we find it impossible

to believe in any truly artistic production, however insignificant,

without objectivity, without pure, interestless contemplation. Hence

our æsthetics must first solve the problem as to how the "lyrist" is

possible as an artist: he who according to the experience of all ages

continually says "I" and sings off to us the entire chromatic scale of

his passions and desires. This very Archilochus appals us, alongside

of Homer, by his cries of hatred and scorn, by the drunken outbursts

of his desire. Is not just he then, who has been called the first

subjective artist, the non-artist proper? But whence then the reverence

which was shown to him&mdash;the poet&mdash;in very remarkable utterances by the

Delphic oracle itself, the focus of "objective" art?</p>



<p><i>Schiller</i> has enlightened us concerning his poetic procedure by a

psychological observation, inexplicable to himself, yet not apparently

open to any objection. He acknowledges that as the preparatory state

to the act of poetising he had not perhaps before him or within him a

series of pictures with co-ordinate causality of thoughts, but rather

a <i>musical mood</i> ("The perception with me is at first without a clear

and definite object; this forms itself later. A certain musical mood

of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> mind precedes, and only after this does the poetical idea follow

with me.") Add to this the most important phenomenon of all ancient

lyric poetry, <i>the union,</i> regarded everywhere as natural, <i>of the

lyrist with the musician,</i> their very identity, indeed,&mdash;compared

with which our modern lyric poetry is like the statue of a god without

a head,&mdash;and we may now, on the basis of our metaphysics of æsthetics

set forth above, interpret the lyrist to ourselves as follows. As

Dionysian artist he is in the first place become altogether one with

the Primordial Unity, its pain and contradiction, and he produces the

copy of this Primordial Unity as music, granting that music has been

correctly termed a repetition and a recast of the world; but now, under

the Apollonian dream-inspiration, this music again becomes visible

to him as in a <i>symbolic dream-picture.</i> The formless and intangible

reflection of the primordial pain in music, with its redemption in

appearance, then generates a second mirroring as a concrete symbol or

example. The artist has already surrendered his subjectivity in the

Dionysian process: the picture which now shows to him his oneness with

the heart of the world, is a dream-scene, which embodies the primordial

contradiction and primordial pain, together with the primordial joy, of

appearance. The "I" of the lyrist sounds therefore from the abyss of

being: its "subjectivity," in the sense of the modern æsthetes, is a

fiction. When Archilochus, the first lyrist of the Greeks, makes known

both his mad love and his contempt to the daughters of Lycambes, it is

not his passion which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> dances before us in orgiastic frenzy: we see

Dionysus and the Mænads, we see the drunken reveller Archilochus sunk

down to sleep&mdash;as Euripides depicts it in the Bacchæ, the sleep on the

high Alpine pasture, in the noonday sun:&mdash;and now Apollo approaches and

touches him with the laurel. The Dionyso-musical enchantment of the

sleeper now emits, as it were, picture sparks, lyrical poems, which in

their highest development are called tragedies and dramatic dithyrambs.</p>



<p>The plastic artist, as also the epic poet, who is related to him, is

sunk in the pure contemplation of pictures. The Dionysian musician

is, without any picture, himself just primordial pain and the

primordial re-echoing thereof. The lyric genius is conscious of a

world of pictures and symbols&mdash;growing out of the state of mystical

self-abnegation and oneness,&mdash;which has a colouring causality and

velocity quite different from that of the world of the plastic artist

and epic poet. While the latter lives in these pictures, and only in

them, with joyful satisfaction, and never grows tired of contemplating

them with love, even in their minutest characters, while even the

picture of the angry Achilles is to him but a picture, the angry

expression of which he enjoys with the dream-joy in appearance&mdash;so

that, by this mirror of appearance, he is guarded against being unified

and blending with his figures;&mdash;the pictures of the lyrist on the other

hand are nothing but <i>his very</i> self and, as it were, only different

projections of himself, on account of which he as the moving centre

of this world is entitled to say "I": only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> of course this self is

not the same as that of the waking, empirically real man, but the

only verily existent and eternal self resting at the basis of things,

by means of the images whereof the lyric genius sees through even to

this basis of things. Now let us suppose that he beholds <i>himself</i>

also among these images as non-genius, <i>i.e.,</i> his subject, the whole

throng of subjective passions and impulses of the will directed to a

definite object which appears real to him; if now it seems as if the

lyric genius and the allied non-genius were one, and as if the former

spoke that little word "I" of his own accord, this appearance will no

longer be able to lead us astray, as it certainly led those astray who

designated the lyrist as the subjective poet. In truth, Archilochus,

the passionately inflamed, loving and hating man, is but a vision of

the genius, who by this time is no longer Archilochus, but a genius

of the world, who expresses his primordial pain symbolically in the

figure of the man Archilochus: while the subjectively willing and

desiring man, Archilochus, can never at any time be a poet. It is by no

means necessary, however, that the lyrist should see nothing but the

phenomenon of the man Archilochus before him as a reflection of eternal

being; and tragedy shows how far the visionary world of the lyrist may

depart from this phenomenon, to which, of course, it is most intimately

related.</p>



<p><i>Schopenhauer,</i> who did not shut his eyes to the difficulty presented

by the lyrist in the philosophical contemplation of art, thought he

had found a way out of it, on which, however, I cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> accompany him;

while he alone, in his profound metaphysics of music, held in his

hands the means whereby this difficulty could be definitely removed:

as I believe I have removed it here in his spirit and to his honour.

In contrast to our view, he describes the peculiar nature of song

as follows<a name="FNanchor_4_6" id="FNanchor_4_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_6" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> (<i>Welt als Wille und Vorstellung,</i> I. 295):&mdash;"It is

the subject of the will, <i>i.e.,</i> his own volition, which fills the

consciousness of the singer; often as an unbound and satisfied desire

(joy), but still more often as a restricted desire (grief), always as

an emotion, a passion, or an agitated frame of mind. Besides this,

however, and along with it, by the sight of surrounding nature, the

singer becomes conscious of himself as the subject of pure will-less

knowing, the unbroken, blissful peace of which now appears, in contrast

to the stress of desire, which is always restricted and always needy.

The feeling of this contrast, this alternation, is really what the

song as a whole expresses and what principally constitutes the lyrical

state of mind. In it pure knowing comes to us as it were to deliver us

from desire and the stress thereof: we follow, but only for an instant;

for desire, the remembrance of our personal ends, tears us anew from

peaceful contemplation; yet ever again the next beautiful surrounding

in which the pure will-less knowledge presents itself to us, allures

us away from desire. Therefore, in song and in the lyrical mood,

desire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> (the personal interest of the ends) and the pure perception of

the surrounding which presents itself, are wonderfully mingled with

each other; connections between them are sought for and imagined; the

subjective disposition, the affection of the will, imparts its own

hue to the contemplated surrounding, and conversely, the surroundings

communicate the reflex of their colour to the will. The true song is

the expression of the whole of this mingled and divided state of mind."</p>



<p>Who could fail to see in this description that lyric poetry is here

characterised as an imperfectly attained art, which seldom and only

as it were in leaps arrives at its goal, indeed, as a semi-art, the

essence of which is said to consist in this, that desire and pure

contemplation, <i>i.e.,</i> the unæsthetic and the æsthetic condition, are

wonderfully mingled with each other? We maintain rather, that this

entire antithesis, according to which, as according to some standard

of value, Schopenhauer, too, still classifies the arts, the antithesis

between the subjective and the objective, is quite out of place in

æsthetics, inasmuch as the subject <i>i.e.,</i> the desiring individual who

furthers his own egoistic ends, can be conceived only as the adversary,

not as the origin of art. In so far as the subject is the artist,

however, he has already been released from his individual will, and has

become as it were the medium, through which the one verily existent

Subject celebrates his redemption in appearance. For this one thing

must above all be clear to us, to our humiliation <i>and</i> exaltation,

that the entire comedy of art is not at all performed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> say, for our

betterment and culture, and that we are just as little the true authors

of this art-world: rather we may assume with regard to ourselves, that

its true author uses us as pictures and artistic projections, and that

we have our highest dignity in our significance as works of art&mdash;for

only as an <i>æsthetic phenomenon</i> is existence and the world eternally

<i>justified:</i>&mdash;while of course our consciousness of this our specific

significance hardly differs from the kind of consciousness which the

soldiers painted on canvas have of the battle represented thereon.

Hence all our knowledge of art is at bottom quite illusory, because, as

knowing persons we are not one and identical with the Being who, as the

sole author and spectator of this comedy of art, prepares a perpetual

entertainment for himself. Only in so far as the genius in the act of

artistic production coalesces with this primordial artist of the world,

does he get a glimpse of the eternal essence of art, for in this state

he is, in a marvellous manner, like the weird picture of the fairy-tale

which can at will turn its eyes and behold itself; he is now at once

subject and object, at once poet, actor, and spectator.</p>

<h4>6.</h4>





<p>With reference to Archilochus, it has been established by critical

research that he introduced the <i>folk-song</i> into literature, and,

on account thereof, deserved, according to the general estimate of

the Greeks, his unique position alongside of Homer. But what is this

popular folk-song in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> contrast to the wholly Apollonian epos? What

else but the <i>perpetuum vestigium</i> of a union of the Apollonian and

the Dionysian? Its enormous diffusion among all peoples, still further

enhanced by ever new births, testifies to the power of this artistic

double impulse of nature: which leaves its vestiges in the popular

song in like manner as the orgiastic movements of a people perpetuate

themselves in its music. Indeed, one might also furnish historical

proofs, that every period which is highly productive in popular songs

has been most violently stirred by Dionysian currents, which we must

always regard as the substratum and prerequisite of the popular song.</p>



<p>First of all, however, we regard the popular song as the musical mirror

of the world, as the Original melody, which now seeks for itself a

parallel dream-phenomenon and expresses it in poetry. <i>Melody is

therefore primary and universal,</i> and as such may admit of several

objectivations, in several texts. Likewise, in the naïve estimation of

the people, it is regarded as by far the more important and necessary.

Melody generates the poem out of itself by an ever-recurring process.

<i>The strophic form of the popular song</i> points to the same phenomenon,

which I always beheld with astonishment, till at last I found this

explanation. Any one who in accordance with this theory examines a

collection of popular songs, such as "Des Knaben Wunderhorn," will find

innumerable instances of the perpetually productive melody scattering

picture sparks all around: which in their variegation, their abrupt

change,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> their mad precipitance, manifest a power quite unknown to the

epic appearance and its steady flow. From the point of view of the

epos, this unequal and irregular pictorial world of lyric poetry must

be simply condemned: and the solemn epic rhapsodists of the Apollonian

festivals in the age of Terpander have certainly done so.</p>



<p>Accordingly, we observe that in the poetising of the popular song,

language is strained to its utmost <i>to imitate music;</i> and hence a

new world of poetry begins with Archilochus, which is fundamentally

opposed to the Homeric. And in saying this we have pointed out the

only possible relation between poetry and music, between word and

tone: the word, the picture, the concept here seeks an expression

analogous to music and now experiences in itself the power of music.

In this sense we may discriminate between two main currents in the

history of the language of the Greek people, according as their

language imitated either the world of phenomena and of pictures, or the

world of music. One has only to reflect seriously on the linguistic

difference with regard to colour, syntactical structure, and vocabulary

in Homer and Pindar, in order to comprehend the significance of this

contrast; indeed, it becomes palpably clear to us that in the period

between Homer and Pindar the <i>orgiastic flute tones of Olympus</i> must

have sounded forth, which, in an age as late as Aristotle's, when

music was infinitely more developed, transported people to drunken

enthusiasm, and which, when their influence was first felt, undoubtedly

incited all the poetic means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> expression of contemporaneous man

to imitation. I here call attention to a familiar phenomenon of our

own times, against which our æsthetics raises many objections. We

again and again have occasion to observe how a symphony of Beethoven

compels the individual hearers to use figurative speech, though the

appearance presented by a collocation of the different pictorial

world generated by a piece of music may be never so fantastically

diversified and even contradictory. To practise its small wit on such

compositions, and to overlook a phenomenon which is certainly worth

explaining, is quite in keeping with this æsthetics. Indeed, even if

the tone-poet has spoken in pictures concerning a composition, when for

instance he designates a certain symphony as the "pastoral" symphony,

or a passage therein as "the scene by the brook," or another as the

"merry gathering of rustics," these are likewise only symbolical

representations born out of music&mdash;and not perhaps the imitated objects

of music&mdash;representations which can give us no information whatever

concerning the <i>Dionysian</i> content of music, and which in fact have

no distinctive value of their own alongside of other pictorical

expressions. This process of a discharge of music in pictures we have

now to transfer to some youthful, linguistically productive people, to

get a notion as to how the strophic popular song originates, and how

the entire faculty of speech is stimulated by this new principle of

imitation of music.</p>



<p>If, therefore, we may regard lyric poetry as the effulguration of

music in pictures and concepts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> we can now ask: "how does music

<i>appear</i> in the mirror of symbolism and conception?" <i>It appears as

will,</i> taking the word in the Schopenhauerian sense, <i>i.e.,</i> as the

antithesis of the æsthetic, purely contemplative, and passive frame

of mind. Here, however, we must discriminate as sharply as possible

between the concept of essentiality and the concept of phenominality;

for music, according to its essence, cannot be will, because as such it

would have to be wholly banished from the domain of art&mdash;for the will

is the unæsthetic-in-itself;&mdash;yet it appears as will. For in order to

express the phenomenon of music in pictures, the lyrist requires all

the stirrings of passion, from the whispering of infant desire to the

roaring of madness. Under the impulse to speak of music in Apollonian

symbols, he conceives of all nature, and himself therein, only as the

eternally willing, desiring, longing existence. But in so far as he

interprets music by means of pictures, he himself rests in the quiet

calm of Apollonian contemplation, however much all around him which

he beholds through the medium of music is in a state of confused and

violent motion. Indeed, when he beholds himself through this same

medium, his own image appears to him in a state of unsatisfied feeling:

his own willing, longing, moaning and rejoicing are to him symbols by

which he interprets music. Such is the phenomenon of the lyrist: as

Apollonian genius he interprets music through the image of the will,

while he himself, completely released from the avidity of the will, is

the pure, undimmed eye of day.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>



<p>Our whole disquisition insists on this, that lyric poetry is dependent

on the spirit of music just as music itself in its absolute sovereignty

does not <i>require</i> the picture and the concept, but only <i>endures</i>

them as accompaniments. The poems of the lyrist can express nothing

which has not already been contained in the vast universality and

absoluteness of the music which compelled him to use figurative

speech. By no means is it possible for language adequately to render

the cosmic symbolism of music, for the very reason that music stands

in symbolic relation to the primordial contradiction and primordial

pain in the heart of the Primordial Unity, and therefore symbolises a

sphere which is above all appearance and before all phenomena. Rather

should we say that all phenomena, compared with it, are but symbols:

hence <i>language,</i> as the organ and symbol of phenomena, cannot at all

disclose the innermost essence, of music; language can only be in

superficial contact with music when it attempts to imitate music; while

the profoundest significance of the latter cannot be brought one step

nearer to us by all the eloquence of lyric poetry.</p>

<p>We shall now have to avail ourselves of all the principles of art

hitherto considered, in order to find our way through the labyrinth,

as we must designate <i>the origin of Greek tragedy.</i> I shall not be

charged with absurdity in saying that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> problem of this origin has

as yet not even been seriously stated, not to say solved, however

often the fluttering tatters of ancient tradition have been sewed

together in sundry combinations and torn asunder again. This tradition

tells us in the most unequivocal terms, <i>that tragedy sprang from the

tragic chorus,</i> and was originally only chorus and nothing but chorus:

and hence we feel it our duty to look into the heart of this tragic

chorus as being the real proto-drama, without in the least contenting

ourselves with current art-phraseology&mdash;according to which the chorus

is the ideal spectator, or represents the people in contrast to the

regal side of the scene. The latter explanatory notion, which sounds

sublime to many a politician&mdash;that the immutable moral law was embodied

by the democratic Athenians in the popular chorus, which always carries

its point over the passionate excesses and extravagances of kings&mdash;may

be ever so forcibly suggested by an observation of Aristotle: still

it has no bearing on the original formation of tragedy, inasmuch

as the entire antithesis of king and people, and, in general, the

whole politico-social sphere, is excluded from the purely religious

beginnings of tragedy; but, considering the well-known classical

form of the chorus in Æschylus and Sophocles, we should even deem

it blasphemy to speak here of the anticipation of a "constitutional

representation of the people," from which blasphemy others have not

shrunk, however. The ancient governments knew of no constitutional

representation of the people <i>in praxi,</i> and it is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> be hoped that

they did not even so much as "anticipate" it in tragedy.</p>



<p>Much more celebrated than this political explanation of the chorus is

the notion of A. W. Schlegel, who advises us to regard the chorus, in

a manner, as the essence and extract of the crowd of spectators,&mdash;as

the "ideal spectator." This view when compared with the historical

tradition that tragedy was originally only chorus, reveals itself

in its true character, as a crude, unscientific, yet brilliant

assertion, which, however, has acquired its brilliancy only through

its concentrated form of expression, through the truly Germanic bias

in favour of whatever is called "ideal," and through our momentary

astonishment. For we are indeed astonished the moment we compare our

well-known theatrical public with this chorus, and ask ourselves if it

could ever be possible to idealise something analogous to the Greek

chorus out of such a public. We tacitly deny this, and now wonder

as much at the boldness of Schlegel's assertion as at the totally

different nature of the Greek public. For hitherto we always believed

that the true spectator, be he who he may, had always to remain

conscious of having before him a work of art, and not an empiric

reality: whereas the tragic chorus of the Greeks is compelled to

recognise real beings in the figures of the stage. The chorus of the

Oceanides really believes that it sees before it the Titan Prometheus,

and considers itself as real as the god of the scene. And are we to

own that he is the highest and purest type of spectator, who, like the

Oceanides, regards Prometheus as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> real and present in body? And is it

characteristic of the ideal spectator that he should run on the stage

and free the god from his torments? We had believed in an æsthetic

public, and considered the individual spectator the better qualified

the more he was capable of viewing a work of art as art, that is,

æsthetically; but now the Schlegelian expression has intimated to us,

that the perfect ideal spectator does not at all suffer the world of

the scenes to act æsthetically on him, but corporeo-empirically. Oh,

these Greeks! we have sighed; they will upset our æsthetics! But once

accustomed to it, we have reiterated the saying of Schlegel, as often

as the subject of the chorus has been broached.</p>



<p>But the tradition which is so explicit here speaks against Schlegel:

the chorus as such, without the stage,&mdash;the primitive form of

tragedy,&mdash;and the chorus of ideal spectators do not harmonise. What

kind of art would that be which was extracted from the concept of the

spectator, and whereof we are to regard the "spectator as such" as the

true form? The spectator without the play is something absurd. We fear

that the birth of tragedy can be explained neither by the high esteem

for the moral intelligence of the multitude nor by the concept of the

spectator without the play; and we regard the problem as too deep to be

even so much as touched by such superficial modes of contemplation.</p>



<p>An infinitely more valuable insight into the signification of the

chorus had already been displayed by Schiller in the celebrated Preface

to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> Bride of Messina, where he regarded the chorus as a living wall

which tragedy draws round herself to guard her from contact with the

world of reality, and to preserve her ideal domain and poetical freedom.</p>



<p>It is with this, his chief weapon, that Schiller combats the ordinary

conception of the natural, the illusion ordinarily required in

dramatic poetry. He contends that while indeed the day on the stage is

merely artificial, the architecture only symbolical, and the metrical

dialogue purely ideal in character, nevertheless an erroneous view

still prevails in the main: that it is not enough to tolerate merely

as a poetical license <i>that</i> which is in reality the essence of all

poetry. The introduction of the chorus is, he says, the decisive step

by which war is declared openly and honestly against all naturalism

in art.&mdash;It is, methinks, for disparaging this mode of contemplation

that our would-be superior age has coined the disdainful catchword

"pseudo-idealism." I fear, however, that we on the other hand with our

present worship of the natural and the real have landed at the nadir

of all idealism, namely in the region of cabinets of wax-figures. An

art indeed exists also here, as in certain novels much in vogue at

present: but let no one pester us with the claim that by this art the

Schiller-Goethian "Pseudo-idealism" has been vanquished.</p>



<p>It is indeed an "ideal" domain, as Schiller rightly perceived,

upon&mdash;which the Greek satyric chorus, the chorus of primitive tragedy,

was wont to walk, a domain raised far above the actual path<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> of

mortals. The Greek framed for this chorus the suspended scaffolding of

a fictitious <i>natural state</i> and placed thereon fictitious <i>natural

beings.</i> It is on this foundation that tragedy grew up, and so it

could of course dispense from the very first with a painful portrayal

of reality. Yet it is, not an arbitrary world placed by fancy betwixt

heaven and earth; rather is it a world possessing the same reality

and trustworthiness that Olympus with its dwellers possessed for the

believing Hellene. The satyr, as being the Dionysian chorist, lives

in a religiously acknowledged reality under the sanction of the myth

and cult. That tragedy begins with him, that the Dionysian wisdom of

tragedy speaks through him, is just as surprising a phenomenon to us

as, in general, the derivation of tragedy from the chorus. Perhaps

we shall get a starting-point for our inquiry, if I put forward the

proposition that the satyr, the fictitious natural being, is to the

man of culture what Dionysian music is to civilisation. Concerning

this latter, Richard Wagner says that it is neutralised by music even

as lamplight by daylight. In like manner, I believe, the Greek man of

culture felt himself neutralised in the presence of the satyric chorus:

and this is the most immediate effect of the Dionysian tragedy, that

the state and society, and, in general, the gaps between man and man

give way to an overwhelming feeling of oneness, which leads back to

the heart of nature. The metaphysical comfort,&mdash;with which, as I have

here intimated, every true tragedy dismisses us&mdash;that, in spite of

the perpetual change of phenomena,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> life at bottom is indestructibly

powerful and pleasurable, this comfort appears with corporeal lucidity

as the satyric chorus, as the chorus of natural beings, who live

ineradicable as it were behind all civilisation, and who, in spite of

the ceaseless change of generations and the history of nations, remain

for ever the same.</p>



<p>With this chorus the deep-minded Hellene, who is so singularly

qualified for the most delicate and severe suffering, consoles

himself:&mdash;he who has glanced with piercing eye into the very heart of

the terrible destructive processes of so-called universal history, as

also into the cruelty of nature, and is in danger of longing for a

Buddhistic negation of the will. Art saves him, and through art life

saves him&mdash;for herself.</p>



<p>For we must know that in the rapture of the Dionysian state, with its

annihilation of the ordinary bounds and limits of existence, there is

a <i>lethargic</i> element, wherein all personal experiences of the past

are submerged. It is by this gulf of oblivion that the everyday world

and the world of Dionysian reality are separated from each other. But

as soon as this everyday reality rises again in consciousness, it is

felt as such, and nauseates us; an ascetic will-paralysing mood is

the fruit of these states. In this sense the Dionysian man may be

said to resemble Hamlet: both have for once seen into the true nature

of things, &mdash;they have <i>perceived,</i> but they are loath to act; for

their action cannot change the eternal nature of things; they regard

it as shameful or ridiculous that one should require of them to set

aright the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> time which is out of joint. Knowledge kills action, action

requires the veil of illusion&mdash;it is this lesson which Hamlet teaches,

and not the cheap wisdom of John-a-Dreams who from too much reflection,

as it were from a surplus of possibilities, does not arrive at action

at all. Not reflection, no!&mdash;true knowledge, insight into appalling

truth, preponderates over all motives inciting to action, in Hamlet as

well as in the Dionysian man. No comfort avails any longer; his longing

goes beyond a world after death, beyond the gods themselves; existence

with its glittering reflection in the gods, or in an immortal other

world is abjured. In the consciousness of the truth he has perceived,

man now sees everywhere only the awfulness or the absurdity of

existence, he now understands the symbolism in the fate of Ophelia, he

now discerns the wisdom of the sylvan god Silenus: and loathing seizes

him.</p>



<p>Here, in this extremest danger of the will, <i>art</i> approaches, as a

saving and healing enchantress; she alone is able to transform these

nauseating reflections on the awfulness or absurdity of existence

into representations wherewith it is possible to live: these are the

representations of the <i>sublime</i> as the artistic subjugation of the

awful, and the <i>comic</i> as the artistic delivery from the nausea of

the absurd. The satyric chorus of dithyramb is the saving deed of

Greek art; the paroxysms described above spent their force in the

intermediary world of these Dionysian followers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>







<h4>8.</h4>





<p>The satyr, like the idyllic shepherd of our more recent time, is the

offspring of a longing after the Primitive and the Natural; but mark

with what firmness and fearlessness the Greek embraced the man of

the woods, and again, how coyly and mawkishly the modern man dallied

with the flattering picture of a tender, flute-playing, soft-natured

shepherd! Nature, on which as yet no knowledge has been at work,

which maintains unbroken barriers to culture&mdash;this is what the Greek

saw in his satyr, which still was not on this account supposed to

coincide with the ape. On the contrary: it was the archetype of

man, the embodiment of his highest and strongest emotions, as the

enthusiastic reveller enraptured By the proximity of his god, as the

fellow-suffering companion in whom the suffering of the god repeats

itself, as the herald of wisdom speaking from the very depths of

nature, as the emblem of the sexual omnipotence of nature, which the

Greek was wont to contemplate with reverential awe. The satyr was

something sublime and godlike: he could not but appear so, especially

to the sad and wearied eye of the Dionysian man. He would have been

offended by our spurious tricked-up shepherd, while his eye dwelt

with sublime satisfaction on the naked and unstuntedly magnificent

characters of nature: here the illusion of culture was brushed away

from the archetype of man; here the true man, the bearded satyr,

revealed himself, who shouts joyfully to his god. Before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> him the

cultured man shrank to a lying caricature. Schiller is right also

with reference to these beginnings of tragic art: the chorus is a

living bulwark against the onsets of reality, because it&mdash;the satyric

chorus&mdash;portrays existence more truthfully, more realistically, more

perfectly than the cultured man who ordinarily considers himself as the

only reality. The sphere of poetry does not lie outside the world, like

some fantastic impossibility of a poet's imagination: it seeks to be

the very opposite, the unvarnished expression of truth, and must for

this very reason cast aside the false finery of that supposed reality

of the cultured man. The contrast between this intrinsic truth of

nature and the falsehood of culture, which poses as the only reality,

is similar to that existing between the eternal kernel of things, the

thing in itself, and the collective world of phenomena. And even as

tragedy, with its metaphysical comfort, points to the eternal life of

this kernel of existence, notwithstanding the perpetual dissolution of

phenomena, so the symbolism of the satyric chorus already expresses

figuratively this primordial relation between the thing in itself and

phenomenon. The idyllic shepherd of the modern man is but a copy of the

sum of the illusions of culture which he calls nature; the Dionysian

Greek desires truth and nature in their most potent form;&mdash;he sees

himself metamorphosed into the satyr.</p>



<p>The revelling crowd of the votaries of Dionysus rejoices, swayed by

such moods and perceptions, the power of which transforms them before

their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> own eyes, so that they imagine they behold themselves as

reconstituted genii of nature, as satyrs. The later constitution of the

tragic chorus is the artistic imitation of this natural phenomenon,

which of course required a separation of the Dionysian spectators from

the enchanted Dionysians. However, we must never lose sight of the fact

that the public of the Attic tragedy rediscovered itself in the chorus

of the orchestra, that there was in reality no antithesis of public

and chorus: for all was but one great sublime chorus of dancing and

singing satyrs, or of such as allowed themselves to be represented by

the satyrs. The Schlegelian observation must here reveal itself to us

in a deeper sense. The chorus is the "ideal spectator"<a name="FNanchor_5_7" id="FNanchor_5_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_7" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> in so far as

it is the only <i>beholder,</i><a name="FNanchor_6_8" id="FNanchor_6_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_8" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> the beholder of the visionary world of

the scene. A public of spectators, as known to us, was unknown to the

Greeks. In their theatres the terraced structure of the spectators'

space rising in concentric arcs enabled every one, in the strictest

sense, to <i>overlook</i> the entire world of culture around him, and in

surfeited contemplation to imagine himself a chorist. According to

this view, then, we may call the chorus in its primitive stage in

proto-tragedy, a self-mirroring of the Dionysian man: a phenomenon

which may be best exemplified by the process of the actor, who, if he

be truly gifted, sees hovering before his eyes with almost tangible

perceptibility the character he is to represent. The satyric chorus

is first of all a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> vision of the Dionysian throng, just as the world

of the stage is, in turn, a vision of the satyric chorus: the power

of this vision is great enough to render the eye dull and insensible

to the impression of "reality," to the presence of the cultured men

occupying the tiers of seats on every side. The form of the Greek

theatre reminds one of a lonesome mountain-valley: the architecture of

the scene appears like a luminous cloud-picture which the Bacchants

swarming on the mountains behold from the heights, as the splendid

encirclement in the midst of which the image of Dionysus is revealed to

them.</p>



<p>Owing to our learned conception of the elementary artistic processes,

this artistic proto-phenomenon, which is here introduced to explain

the tragic chorus, is almost shocking: while nothing can be more

certain than that the poet is a poet only in that he beholds himself

surrounded by forms which live and act before him, into the innermost

being of which his glance penetrates. By reason of a strange defeat in

our capacities, we modern men are apt to represent to ourselves the

æsthetic proto-phenomenon as too complex and abstract. For the true

poet the metaphor is not a rhetorical figure, but a vicarious image

which actually hovers before him in place of a concept. The character

is not for him an aggregate composed of a studied collection of

particular traits, but an irrepressibly live person appearing before

his eyes, and differing only from the corresponding vision of the

painter by its ever continued life and action. Why is it that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> Homer

sketches much more vividly<a name="FNanchor_7_9" id="FNanchor_7_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_9" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> than all the other poets? Because he

contemplates<a name="FNanchor_8_10" id="FNanchor_8_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_10" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> much more. We talk so abstractly about poetry, because

we are all wont to be bad poets. At bottom the æsthetic phenomenon is

simple: let a man but have the faculty of perpetually seeing a lively

play and of constantly living surrounded by hosts of spirits, then he

is a poet: let him but feel the impulse to transform himself and to

talk from out the bodies and souls of others, then he is a dramatist.</p>



<p>The Dionysian excitement is able to impart to a whole mass of men

this artistic faculty of seeing themselves surrounded by such a host

of spirits, with whom they know themselves to be inwardly one. This

function of the tragic chorus is the <i>dramatic</i> proto-phenomenon: to

see one's self transformed before one's self, and then to act as if

one had really entered into another body, into another character. This

function stands at the beginning of the development of the drama.

Here we have something different from the rhapsodist, who does not

blend with his pictures, but only sees them, like the painter, with

contemplative eye outside of him; here we actually have a surrender

of the individual by his entering into another nature. Moreover this

phenomenon appears in the form of an epidemic: a whole throng feels

itself metamorphosed in this wise. Hence it is that the dithyramb is

essentially different from every other variety of the choric song. The

virgins, who with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> laurel twigs in their hands solemnly proceed to

the temple of Apollo and sing a processional hymn, remain what they

are and retain their civic names: the dithyrambic chorus is a chorus

of transformed beings, whose civic past and social rank are totally

forgotten: they have become the timeless servants of their god that

live aloof from all the spheres of society. Every other variety of

the choric lyric of the Hellenes is but an enormous enhancement of

the Apollonian unit-singer: while in the dithyramb we have before us

a community of unconscious actors, who mutually regard themselves as

transformed among one another.</p>



<p>This enchantment is the prerequisite of all dramatic art. In this

enchantment the Dionysian reveller sees himself as a satyr, <i>and as

satyr he in turn beholds the god,</i> that is, in his transformation he

sees a new vision outside him as the Apollonian consummation of his

state. With this new vision the drama is complete.</p>



<p>According to this view, we must understand Greek tragedy as the

Dionysian chorus, which always disburdens itself anew in an Apollonian

world of pictures. The choric parts, therefore, with which tragedy is

interlaced, are in a manner the mother-womb of the entire so-called

dialogue, that is, of the whole stage-world, of the drama proper. In

several successive outbursts does this primordial basis of tragedy beam

forth the vision of the drama, which is a dream-phenomenon throughout,

and, as such, epic in character: on the other hand, however, as

objectivation of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> Dionysian state, it does not represent the

Apollonian redemption in appearance, but, conversely, the dissolution

of the individual and his unification with primordial existence.

Accordingly, the drama is the Apollonian embodiment of Dionysian

perceptions and influences, and is thereby separated from the epic as

by an immense gap.</p>



<p>The <i>chorus</i> of Greek tragedy, the symbol of the mass of the people

moved by Dionysian excitement, is thus fully explained by our

conception of it as here set forth. Whereas, being accustomed to the

position of a chorus on the modern stage, especially an operatic

chorus, we could never comprehend why the tragic chorus of the Greeks

should be older, more primitive, indeed, more important than the

"action" proper,&mdash;as has been so plainly declared by the voice of

tradition; whereas, furthermore, we could not reconcile with this

traditional paramount importance and primitiveness the fact of the

chorus' being composed only of humble, ministering beings; indeed, at

first only of goatlike satyrs; whereas, finally, the orchestra before

the scene was always a riddle to us; we have learned to comprehend at

length that the scene, together with the action, was fundamentally

and originally conceived only as a <i>vision,</i> that the only reality

is just the chorus, which of itself generates the vision and speaks

thereof with the entire symbolism of dancing, tone, and word. This

chorus beholds in the vision its lord and master Dionysus, and is thus

for ever the <i>serving</i> chorus: it sees how he, the god, suffers and

glorifies himself, and therefore does not itself <i>act</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> But though its

attitude towards the god is throughout the attitude of ministration,

this is nevertheless the highest expression, the Dionysian expression

of <i>Nature,</i> and therefore, like Nature herself, the chorus utters

oracles and wise sayings when transported with enthusiasm: as

<i>fellow-sufferer</i> it is also the <i>sage</i> proclaiming truth from out the

heart of Nature. Thus, then, originates the fantastic figure, which

seems so shocking, of the wise and enthusiastic satyr, who is at the

same time "the dumb man" in contrast to the god: the image of Nature

and her strongest impulses, yea, the symbol of Nature, and at the same

time the herald of her art and wisdom: musician, poet, dancer, and

visionary in one person.</p>



<p>Agreeably to this view, and agreeably to tradition, <i>Dionysus,</i> the

proper stage-hero and focus of vision, is not at first actually present

in the oldest period of tragedy, but is only imagined as present:

<i>i.e.,</i> tragedy is originally only "chorus" and not "drama." Later

on the attempt is made to exhibit the god as real and to display the

visionary figure together with its glorifying encirclement before the

eyes of all; it is here that the "drama" in the narrow sense of the

term begins. To the dithyrambic chorus is now assigned the task of

exciting the minds of the hearers to such a pitch of Dionysian frenzy,

that, when the tragic hero appears on the stage, they do not behold

in him, say, the unshapely masked man, but a visionary figure, born

as it were of their own ecstasy. Let us picture Admetes thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> in

profound meditation of his lately departed wife Alcestis, and quite

consuming himself in spiritual contemplation thereof&mdash;when suddenly

the veiled figure of a woman resembling her in form and gait is led

towards him: let us picture his sudden trembling anxiety, his agitated

comparisons, his instinctive conviction&mdash;and we shall have an analogon

to the sensation with which the spectator, excited to Dionysian frenzy,

saw the god approaching on the stage, a god with whose sufferings he

had already become identified. He involuntarily transferred the entire

picture of the god, fluttering magically before his soul, to this

masked figure and resolved its reality as it were into a phantasmal

unreality. This is the Apollonian dream-state, in which the world

of day is veiled, and a new world, clearer, more intelligible, more

striking than the former, and nevertheless more shadowy, is ever born

anew in perpetual change before our eyes. We accordingly recognise in

tragedy a thorough-going stylistic contrast: the language, colour,

flexibility and dynamics of the dialogue fall apart in the Dionysian

lyrics of the chorus on the one hand, and in the Apollonian dream-world

of the scene on the other, into entirely separate spheres of

expression. The Apollonian appearances, in which Dionysus objectifies

himself, are no longer "ein ewiges Meer, ein wechselnd Weben, ein

glühend Leben,"<a name="FNanchor_9_11" id="FNanchor_9_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_11" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> as is the music of the chorus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> they are no longer

the forces merely felt, but not condensed into a picture, by which

the inspired votary of Dionysus divines the proximity of his god: the

clearness and firmness of epic form now speak to him from the scene,

Dionysus now no longer speaks through forces, but as an epic hero,

almost in the language of Homer.</p>

<h4>9.</h4>





<p>Whatever rises to the surface in the dialogue of the Apollonian part

of Greek tragedy, appears simple, transparent, beautiful. In this

sense the dialogue is a copy of the Hellene, whose nature reveals

itself in the dance, because in the dance the greatest energy is merely

potential, but betrays itself nevertheless in flexible and vivacious

movements. The language of the Sophoclean heroes, for instance,

surprises us by its Apollonian precision and clearness, so that we at

once imagine we see into the innermost recesses of their being, and

marvel not a little that the way to these recesses is so short. But

if for the moment we disregard the character of the hero which rises

to the surface and grows visible&mdash;and which at bottom is nothing but

the light-picture cast on a dark wall, that is, appearance through and

through,&mdash;if rather we enter into the myth which projects itself in

these bright mirrorings, we shall of a sudden experience a phenomenon

which bears a reverse relation to one familiar in optics. When, after

a vigorous effort to gaze into the sun, we turn away blinded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> we have

dark-coloured spots before our eyes as restoratives, so to speak;

while, on the contrary, those light-picture phenomena of the Sophoclean

hero,&mdash;in short, the Apollonian of the mask,&mdash;are the necessary

productions of a glance into the secret and terrible things of nature,

as it were shining spots to heal the eye which dire night has seared.

Only in this sense can we hope to be able to grasp the true meaning of

the serious and significant notion of "Greek cheerfulness"; while of

course we encounter the misunderstood notion of this cheerfulness, as

resulting from a state of unendangered comfort, on all the ways and

paths of the present time.</p>



<p>The most sorrowful figure of the Greek stage, the hapless <i>Œdipus,</i>

was understood by Sophocles as the noble man, who in spite of his

wisdom was destined to error and misery, but nevertheless through

his extraordinary sufferings ultimately exerted a magical, wholesome

influence on all around him, which continues effective even after

his death. The noble man does not sin; this is what the thoughtful

poet wishes to tell us: all laws, all natural order, yea, the moral

world itself, may be destroyed through his action, but through this

very action a higher magic circle of influences is brought into play,

which establish a new world on the ruins of the old that has been

overthrown. This is what the poet, in so far as he is at the same time

a religious thinker, wishes to tell us: as poet, he shows us first of

all a wonderfully complicated legal mystery, which the judge slowly

unravels, link by link, to his own destruction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> The truly Hellenic

delight at this dialectical loosening is so great, that a touch of

surpassing cheerfulness is thereby communicated to the entire play,

which everywhere blunts the edge of the horrible presuppositions of the

procedure. In the "Œdipus at Colonus" we find the same cheerfulness,

elevated, however, to an infinite transfiguration: in contrast to

the aged king, subjected to an excess of misery, and exposed solely

as a <i>sufferer</i> to all that befalls him, we have here a supermundane

cheerfulness, which descends from a divine sphere and intimates to

us that in his purely passive attitude the hero attains his highest

activity, the influence of which extends far beyond his life, while

his earlier conscious musing and striving led him only to passivity.

Thus, then, the legal knot of the fable of Œdipus, which to mortal

eyes appears indissolubly entangled, is slowly unravelled&mdash;and the

profoundest human joy comes upon us in the presence of this divine

counterpart of dialectics. If this explanation does justice to the

poet, it may still be asked whether the substance of the myth is

thereby exhausted; and here it turns out that the entire conception

of the poet is nothing but the light-picture which healing nature

holds up to us after a glance into the abyss. Œdipus, the murderer of

his father, the husband of his mother, Œdipus, the interpreter of the

riddle of the Sphinx! What does the mysterious triad of these deeds

of destiny tell us? There is a primitive popular belief, especially

in Persia, that a wise Magian can be born only of incest: which

we have forthwith to interpret to ourselves with reference to the

riddle-solving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> and mother-marrying Œdipus, to the effect that when

the boundary of the present and future, the rigid law of individuation

and, in general, the intrinsic spell of nature, are broken by prophetic

and magical powers, an extraordinary counter-naturalness&mdash;as, in this

case, incest&mdash;must have preceded as a cause; for how else could one

force nature to surrender her secrets but by victoriously opposing her,

<i>i.e.,</i> by means of the Unnatural? It is this intuition which I see

imprinted in the awful triad of the destiny of Œdipus: the very man

who solves the riddle of nature&mdash;that double-constituted Sphinx&mdash;must

also, as the murderer of his father and husband of his mother, break

the holiest laws of nature. Indeed, it seems as if the myth sought to

whisper into our ears that wisdom, especially Dionysian wisdom, is

an unnatural abomination, and that whoever, through his knowledge,

plunges nature into an abyss of annihilation, must also experience

the dissolution of nature in himself. "The sharpness of wisdom turns

round upon the sage: wisdom is a crime against nature": such terrible

expressions does the myth call out to us: but the Hellenic poet touches

like a sunbeam the sublime and formidable Memnonian statue of the myth,

so that it suddenly begins to sound&mdash;in Sophoclean melodies.</p>



<p>With the glory of passivity I now contrast the glory of activity which

illuminates the <i>Prometheus</i> of Æschylus. That which Æschylus the

thinker had to tell us here, but which as a poet he only allows us to

surmise by his symbolic picture, the youthful Goethe succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> in

disclosing to us in the daring words of his Prometheus:&mdash;</p>



<p style="margin-left: 10%;">

"Hier sitz' ich, forme Menschen<br />

</p>



<p>Man, elevating himself to the rank of the Titans, acquires his culture

by his own efforts, and compels the gods to unite with him, because

in his self-sufficient wisdom he has their existence and their limits

in his hand. What is most wonderful, however, in this Promethean

form, which according to its fundamental conception is the specific

hymn of impiety, is the profound Æschylean yearning for <i>justice</i>:

the untold sorrow of the bold "single-handed being" on the one hand,

and the divine need, ay, the foreboding of a twilight of the gods, on

the other, the power of these two worlds of suffering constraining

to reconciliation, to metaphysical oneness&mdash;all this suggests most

forcibly the central and main position of the Æschylean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span> view of

things, which sees Moira as eternal justice enthroned above gods and

men. In view of the astonishing boldness with which Æschylus places the

Olympian world on his scales of justice, it must be remembered that

the deep-minded Greek had an immovably firm substratum of metaphysical

thought in his mysteries, and that all his sceptical paroxysms could

be discharged upon the Olympians. With reference to these deities,

the Greek artist, in particular, had an obscure feeling as to mutual

dependency: and it is just in the Prometheus of Æschylus that this

feeling is symbolised. The Titanic artist found in himself the

daring belief that he could create men and at least destroy Olympian

deities: namely, by his superior wisdom, for which, to be sure, he had

to atone by eternal suffering. The splendid "can-ing" of the great

genius, bought too cheaply even at the price of eternal suffering,

the stern pride of the <i>artist</i>: this is the essence and soul of

Æschylean poetry, while Sophocles in his Œdipus preludingly strikes up

the victory-song of the <i>saint</i>. But even this interpretation which

Æschylus has given to the myth does not fathom its astounding depth of

terror; the fact is rather that the artist's delight in unfolding, the

cheerfulness of artistic creating bidding defiance to all calamity,

is but a shining stellar and nebular image reflected in a black sea

of sadness. The tale of Prometheus is an original possession of the

entire Aryan family of races, and documentary evidence of their

capacity for the profoundly tragic; indeed, it is not improbable that

this myth has the same characteristic significance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> for the Aryan

race that the myth of the fall of man has for the Semitic, and that

there is a relationship between the two myths like that of brother and

sister. The presupposition of the Promethean myth is the transcendent

value which a naïve humanity attach to <i>fire</i> as the true palladium

of every ascending culture: that man, however, should dispose at will

of this fire, and should not receive it only as a gift from heaven,

as the igniting lightning or the warming solar flame, appeared to the

contemplative primordial men as crime and robbery of the divine nature.

And thus the first philosophical problem at once causes a painful,

irreconcilable antagonism between man and God, and puts as it were

a mass of rock at the gate of every culture. The best and highest

that men can acquire they obtain by a crime, and must now in their

turn take upon themselves its consequences, namely the whole flood of

sufferings and sorrows with which the offended celestials <i>must</i> visit

the nobly aspiring race of man: a bitter reflection, which, by the

<i>dignity</i> it confers on crime, contrasts strangely with the Semitic

myth of the fall of man, in which curiosity, beguilement, seducibility,

wantonness,&mdash;in short, a whole series of pre-eminently feminine

passions,&mdash;were regarded as the origin of evil. What distinguishes

the Aryan representation is the sublime view of <i>active sin</i> as the

properly Promethean virtue, which suggests at the same time the ethical

basis of pessimistic tragedy as the <i>justification</i> of human evil&mdash;of

human guilt as well as of the suffering incurred thereby. The misery in

the essence of things&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> the contemplative Aryan is not disposed

to explain away&mdash;the antagonism in the heart of the world, manifests

itself to him as a medley of different worlds, for instance, a Divine

and a human world, each of which is in the right individually, but

as a separate existence alongside of another has to suffer for its

individuation. With the heroic effort made by the individual for

universality, in his attempt to pass beyond the bounds of individuation

and become the <i>one</i> universal being, he experiences in himself the

primordial contradiction concealed in the essence of things, <i>i.e.,</i>

he trespasses and suffers. Accordingly crime<a name="FNanchor_11_13" id="FNanchor_11_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_13" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> is understood by

the Aryans to be a man, sin<a name="FNanchor_12_14" id="FNanchor_12_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_14" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> by the Semites a woman; as also, the

original crime is committed by man, the original sin by woman. Besides,

the witches' chorus says:</p>



<p style="margin-left: 10%;">

"Wir nehmen das nicht so genau:<br />

Mit tausend Schritten macht's die Frau;<br />

Doch wie sie auch sich eilen kann<br />

Mit einem Sprunge macht's der Mann."<a name="FNanchor_13_15" id="FNanchor_13_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_15" class="fnanchor">[13]</a><br />

</p>



<p>He who understands this innermost core of the tale of

Prometheus&mdash;namely the necessity of crime imposed on the titanically

striving individual&mdash;will at once be conscious of the un-Apollonian

nature of this pessimistic representation: for Apollo seeks to pacify

individual beings precisely by drawing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> boundary lines between them,

and by again and again calling attention thereto, with his requirements

of self-knowledge and due proportion, as the holiest laws of the

universe. In order, however, to prevent the form from congealing to

Egyptian rigidity and coldness in consequence of this Apollonian

tendency, in order to prevent the extinction of the motion of the

entire lake in the effort to prescribe to the individual wave its path

and compass, the high tide of the Dionysian tendency destroyed from

time to time all the little circles in which the one-sided Apollonian

"will" sought to confine the Hellenic world. The suddenly swelling

tide of the Dionysian then takes the separate little wave-mountains of

individuals on its back, just as the brother of Prometheus, the Titan

Atlas, does with the earth. This Titanic impulse, to become as it were

the Atlas of all individuals, and to carry them on broad shoulders

higher and higher, farther and farther, is what the Promethean and the

Dionysian have in common. In this respect the Æschylean Prometheus is

a Dionysian mask, while, in the afore-mentioned profound yearning for

justice, Æschylus betrays to the intelligent observer his paternal

descent from Apollo, the god of individuation and of the boundaries

of justice. And so the double-being of the Æschylean Prometheus, his

conjoint Dionysian and Apollonian nature, might be thus expressed in

an abstract formula: "Whatever exists is alike just and unjust, and

equally justified in both."</p>

<p>It is an indisputable tradition that Greek tragedy in its earliest

form had for its theme only the sufferings of Dionysus, and that for

some time the only stage-hero therein was simply Dionysus himself.

With the same confidence, however, we can maintain that not until

Euripides did Dionysus cease to be the tragic hero, and that in fact

all the celebrated figures of the Greek stage&mdash;Prometheus, Œdipus,

etc.&mdash;are but masks of this original hero, Dionysus. The presence of a

god behind all these masks is the one essential cause of the typical

"ideality," so oft exciting wonder, of these celebrated figures. Some

one, I know not whom, has maintained that all individuals are comic as

individuals and are consequently un-tragic: from whence it might be

inferred that the Greeks in general <i>could</i> not endure individuals on

the tragic stage. And they really seem to have had these sentiments:

as, in general, it is to be observed that the Platonic discrimination

and valuation of the "idea" in contrast to the "eidolon," the image,

is deeply rooted in the Hellenic being. Availing ourselves of Plato's

terminology, however, we should have to speak of the tragic figures of

the Hellenic stage somewhat as follows. The one truly real Dionysus

appears in a multiplicity of forms, in the mask of a fighting hero

and entangled, as it were, in the net of an individual will. As the

visibly appearing god now talks and acts, he resembles an erring,

striving, suffering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> individual: and that, in general, he <i>appears</i>

with such epic precision and clearness, is due to the dream-reading

Apollo, who reads to the chorus its Dionysian state through this

symbolic appearance. In reality, however, this hero is the suffering

Dionysus of the mysteries, a god experiencing in himself the sufferings

of individuation, of whom wonderful myths tell that as a boy he was

dismembered by the Titans and has been worshipped in this state

as Zagreus:<a name="FNanchor_15_17" id="FNanchor_15_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_17" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> whereby is intimated that this dismemberment, the

properly Dionysian <i>suffering,</i> is like a transformation into air,

water, earth, and fire, that we must therefore regard the state of

individuation as the source and primal cause of all suffering, as

something objectionable in itself. From the smile of this Dionysus

sprang the Olympian gods, from his tears sprang man. In his existence

as a dismembered god, Dionysus has the dual nature of a cruel

barbarised demon, and a mild pacific ruler. But the hope of the epopts

looked for a new birth of Dionysus, which we have now to conceive of in

anticipation as the end of individuation: it was for this coming third

Dionysus that the stormy jubilation-hymns of the epopts resounded. And

it is only this hope that sheds a ray of joy upon the features of a

world torn asunder and shattered into individuals: as is symbolised in

the myth by Demeter sunk in eternal sadness, who <i>rejoices</i> again only

when told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> that she may <i>once more</i> give birth to Dionysus In the views

of things here given we already have all the elements of a profound and

pessimistic contemplation of the world, and along with these we have

the <i>mystery doctrine of tragedy</i>: the fundamental knowledge of the

oneness of all existing things, the consideration of individuation as

the primal cause of evil, and art as the joyous hope that the spell of

individuation may be broken, as the augury of a restored oneness.</p>



<p>It has already been intimated that the Homeric epos is the poem

of Olympian culture, wherewith this culture has sung its own song

of triumph over the terrors of the war of the Titans. Under the

predominating influence of tragic poetry, these Homeric myths are now

reproduced anew, and show by this metempsychosis that meantime the

Olympian culture also has been vanquished by a still deeper view of

things. The haughty Titan Prometheus has announced to his Olympian

tormentor that the extremest danger will one day menace his rule,

unless he ally with him betimes. In Æschylus we perceive the terrified

Zeus, apprehensive of his end, in alliance with the Titan. Thus, the

former age of the Titans is subsequently brought from Tartarus once

more to the light of day. The philosophy of wild and naked nature

beholds with the undissembled mien of truth the myths of the Homeric

world as they dance past: they turn pale, they tremble before the

lightning glance of this goddess&mdash;till the powerful fist<a name="FNanchor_16_18" id="FNanchor_16_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_18" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>

the Dionysian artist forces them into the service of the new deity.

Dionysian truth takes over the entire domain of myth as symbolism of

<i>its</i> knowledge, which it makes known partly in the public cult of

tragedy and partly in the secret celebration of the dramatic mysteries,

always, however, in the old mythical garb. What was the power, which

freed Prometheus from his vultures and transformed the myth into a

vehicle of Dionysian wisdom? It is the Heracleian power of music:

which, having reached its highest manifestness in tragedy, can invest

myths with a new and most profound significance, which we have already

had occasion to characterise as the most powerful faculty of music. For

it is the fate of every myth to insinuate itself into the narrow limits

of some alleged historical reality, and to be treated by some later

generation as a solitary fact with historical claims: and the Greeks

were already fairly on the way to restamp the whole of their mythical

juvenile dream sagaciously and arbitrarily into a historico-pragmatical

<i>juvenile history.</i> For this is the manner in which religions are

wont to die out: when of course under the stern, intelligent eyes of

an orthodox dogmatism, the mythical presuppositions of a religion are

systematised as a completed sum of historical events, and when one

begins apprehensively to defend the credibility of the myth, while at

the same time opposing all continuation of their natural vitality and

luxuriance; when, accordingly, the feeling for myth dies out, and its

place is taken by the claim of religion to historical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> foundations.

This dying myth was now seized by the new-born genius of Dionysian

music, in whose hands it bloomed once more, with such colours as it

had never yet displayed, with a fragrance that awakened a longing

anticipation of a metaphysical world. After this final effulgence

it collapses, its leaves wither, and soon the scoffing Lucians of

antiquity catch at the discoloured and faded flowers which the winds

carry off in every direction. Through tragedy the myth attains its

profoundest significance, its most expressive form; it rises once more

like a wounded hero, and the whole surplus of vitality, together with

the philosophical calmness of the Dying, burns in its eyes with a last

powerful gleam.</p>



<p>What meantest thou, oh impious Euripides, in seeking once more to

enthral this dying one? It died under thy ruthless hands: and then

thou madest use of counterfeit, masked myth, which like the ape of

Heracles could only trick itself out in the old finery. And as myth

died in thy hands, so also died the genius of music; though thou

couldst covetously plunder all the gardens of music&mdash;thou didst only

realise a counterfeit, masked music. And because thou hast forsaken

Dionysus. Apollo hath also forsaken thee; rout up all the passions from

their haunts and conjure them into thy sphere, sharpen and polish a

sophistical dialectics for the speeches of thy heroes&mdash;thy very heroes

have only counterfeit, masked passions, and speak only counterfeit,

masked music.</p>

<h4>11.</h4>





<p>Greek tragedy had a fate different from that of all her older sister

arts: she died by suicide, in consequence of an irreconcilable

conflict; accordingly she died tragically, while they all passed away

very calmly and beautifully in ripe old age. For if it be in accordance

with a happy state of things to depart this life without a struggle,

leaving behind a fair posterity, the closing period of these older

arts exhibits such a happy state of things: slowly they sink out of

sight, and before their dying eyes already stand their fairer progeny,

who impatiently lift up their heads with courageous mien. The death of

Greek tragedy, on the other hand, left an immense void, deeply felt

everywhere. Even as certain Greek sailors in the time of Tiberius once

heard upon a lonesome island the thrilling cry, "great Pan is dead": so

now as it were sorrowful wailing sounded through the Hellenic world:

"Tragedy is dead! Poetry itself has perished with her! Begone, begone,

ye stunted, emaciated epigones! Begone to Hades, that ye may for once

eat your fill of the crumbs of your former masters!"</p>



<p>But when after all a new Art blossomed forth which revered tragedy as

her ancestress and mistress, it was observed with horror that she did

indeed bear the features of her mother, but those very features the

latter had exhibited in her long death-struggle. It was <i>Euripides</i> who

fought this death-struggle of tragedy; the later art is known as the

<i>New Attic Comedy.</i> In it the degenerate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> form of tragedy lived on as a

monument of the most painful and violent death of tragedy proper.</p>



<p>This connection between the two serves to explain the passionate

attachment to Euripides evinced by the poets of the New Comedy, and

hence we are no longer surprised at the wish of Philemon, who would

have got himself hanged at once, with the sole design of being able

to visit Euripides in the lower regions: if only he could be assured

generally that the deceased still had his wits. But if we desire, as

briefly as possible, and without professing to say aught exhaustive on

the subject, to characterise what Euripides has in common with Menander

and Philemon, and what appealed to them so strongly as worthy of

imitation: it will suffice to say that the <i>spectator</i> was brought upon

the stage by Euripides. He who has perceived the material of which the

Promethean tragic writers prior to Euripides formed their heroes, and

how remote from their purpose it was to bring the true mask of reality

on the stage, will also know what to make of the wholly divergent

tendency of Euripides. Through him the commonplace individual forced

his way from the spectators' benches to the stage itself; the mirror in

which formerly only great and bold traits found expression now showed

the painful exactness that conscientiously reproduces even the abortive

lines of nature. Odysseus, the typical Hellene of the Old Art, sank,

in the hands of the new poets, to the figure of the Græculus, who, as

the good-naturedly cunning domestic slave, stands henceforth in the

centre of dramatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> interest. What Euripides takes credit for in the

Aristophanean "Frogs," namely, that by his household remedies he freed

tragic art from its pompous corpulency, is apparent above all in his

tragic heroes. The spectator now virtually saw and heard his double on

the Euripidean stage, and rejoiced that he could talk so well. But this

joy was not all: one even learned of Euripides how to speak: he prides

himself upon this in his contest with Æschylus: how the people have

learned from him how to observe, debate, and draw conclusions according

to the rules of art and with the cleverest sophistications. In general

it may be said that through this revolution of the popular language he

made the New Comedy possible. For it was henceforth no longer a secret,

how&mdash;and with what saws&mdash;the commonplace could represent and express

itself on the stage. Civic mediocrity, on which Euripides built all

his political hopes, was now suffered to speak, while heretofore the

demigod in tragedy and the drunken satyr, or demiman, in comedy, had

determined the character of the language. And so the Aristophanean

Euripides prides himself on having portrayed the common, familiar,

everyday life and dealings of the people, concerning which all are

qualified to pass judgment. If now the entire populace philosophises,

manages land and goods with unheard-of circumspection, and conducts

law-suits, he takes all the credit to himself, and glories in the

splendid results of the wisdom with which he inoculated the rabble.</p>



<p>It was to a populace prepared and enlightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> in this manner that the

New Comedy could now address itself, of which Euripides had become

as it were the chorus-master; only that in this case the chorus of

spectators had to be trained. As soon as this chorus was trained to

sing in the Euripidean key, there arose that chesslike variety of the

drama, the New Comedy, with its perpetual triumphs of cunning and

artfulness. But Euripides&mdash;the chorus-master&mdash;was praised incessantly:

indeed, people would have killed themselves in order to learn yet more

from him, had they not known that tragic poets were quite as dead as

tragedy. But with it the Hellene had surrendered the belief in his

immortality; not only the belief in an ideal past, but also the belief

in an ideal future. The saying taken from the well-known epitaph, "as

an old man, frivolous and capricious," applies also to aged Hellenism.

The passing moment, wit, levity, and caprice, are its highest deities;

the fifth class, that of the slaves, now attains to power, at least in

sentiment: and if we can still speak at all of "Greek cheerfulness,"

it is the cheerfulness of the slave who has nothing of consequence to

answer for, nothing great to strive for, and cannot value anything of

the past or future higher than the present. It was this semblance of

"Greek cheerfulness" which so revolted the deep-minded and formidable

natures of the first four centuries of Christianity: this womanish

flight from earnestness and terror, this cowardly contentedness with

easy pleasure, was not only contemptible to them, but seemed to be a

specifically anti-Christian sentiment. And we must ascribe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> it to its

influence that the conception of Greek antiquity, which lived on for

centuries, preserved with almost enduring persistency that peculiar

hectic colour of cheerfulness&mdash;as if there had never been a Sixth

Century with its birth of tragedy, its Mysteries, its Pythagoras and

Heraclitus, indeed as if the art-works of that great period did not at

all exist, which in fact&mdash;each by itself&mdash;can in no wise be explained

as having sprung from the soil of such a decrepit and slavish love

of existence and cheerfulness, and point to an altogether different

conception of things as their source.</p>



<p>The assertion made a moment ago, that Euripides introduced the

spectator on the stage to qualify him the better to pass judgment on

the drama, will make it appear as if the old tragic art was always

in a false relation to the spectator: and one would be tempted to

extol the radical tendency of Euripides to bring about an adequate

relation between art-work and public as an advance on Sophocles. But,

as things are, "public" is merely a word, and not at all a homogeneous

and constant quantity. Why should the artist be under obligations to

accommodate himself to a power whose strength is merely in numbers?

And if by virtue of his endowments and aspirations he feels himself

superior to every one of these spectators, how could he feel greater

respect for the collective expression of all these subordinate

capacities than for the relatively highest-endowed individual

spectator? In truth, if ever a Greek artist treated his public

throughout a long life with presumptuousness and self-sufficiency,

it was Euripides, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> even when the masses threw themselves at his

feet, with sublime defiance made an open assault on his own tendency,

the very tendency with which he had triumphed over the masses. If this

genius had had the slightest reverence for the pandemonium of the

public, he would have broken down long before the middle of his career

beneath the weighty blows of his own failures. These considerations

here make it obvious that our formula&mdash;namely, that Euripides brought

the spectator upon the stage, in order to make him truly competent to

pass judgment&mdash;was but a provisional one, and that we must seek for a

deeper understanding of his tendency. Conversely, it is undoubtedly

well known that Æschylus and Sophocles, during all their lives, indeed,

far beyond their lives, enjoyed the full favour of the people, and that

therefore in the case of these predecessors of Euripides the idea of

a false relation between art-work and public was altogether excluded.

What was it that thus forcibly diverted this highly gifted artist, so

incessantly impelled to production, from the path over which shone the

sun of the greatest names in poetry and the cloudless heaven of popular

favour? What strange consideration for the spectator led him to defy,

the spectator? How could he, owing to too much respect for the public

&mdash;dis-respect the public?</p>



<p>Euripides&mdash;and this is the solution of the riddle just propounded&mdash;felt

himself, as a poet, undoubtedly superior to the masses, but not to

two of his spectators: he brought the masses upon the stage; these

two spectators he revered as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> only competent judges and masters

of his art: in compliance with their directions and admonitions, he

transferred the entire world of sentiments, passions, and experiences,

hitherto present at every festival representation as the invisible

chorus on the spectators' benches, into the souls of his stage-heroes;

he yielded to their demands when he also sought for these new

characters the new word and the new tone; in their voices alone he

heard the conclusive verdict on his work, as also the cheering promise

of triumph when he found himself condemned as usual by the justice of

the public.</p>



<p>Of these two, spectators the one is&mdash;Euripides himself, Euripides <i>as

thinker,</i> not as poet. It might be said of him, that his unusually

large fund of critical ability, as in the case of Lessing, if it did

not create, at least constantly fructified a productively artistic

collateral impulse. With this faculty, with all the clearness and

dexterity of his critical thought, Euripides had sat in the theatre and

striven to recognise in the masterpieces of his great predecessors, as

in faded paintings, feature and feature, line and line. And here had

happened to him what one initiated in the deeper arcana of Æschylean

tragedy must needs have expected: he observed something incommensurable

in every feature and in every line, a certain deceptive distinctness

and at the same time an enigmatic profundity, yea an infinitude, of

background. Even the clearest figure had always a comet's tail attached

to it, which seemed to suggest the uncertain and the inexplicable.

The same twilight shrouded the structure of the drama, especially the

significance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> of the chorus. And how doubtful seemed the solution of

the ethical problems to his mind! How questionable the treatment of

the myths! How unequal the distribution of happiness and misfortune!

Even in the language of the Old Tragedy there was much that was

objectionable to him, or at least enigmatical; he found especially

too much pomp for simple affairs, too many tropes and immense things

for the plainness of the characters. Thus he sat restlessly pondering

in the theatre, and as a spectator he acknowledged to himself that he

did not understand his great predecessors. If, however, he thought the

understanding the root proper of all enjoyment and productivity, he had

to inquire and look about to see whether any one else thought as he

did, and also acknowledged this incommensurability. But most people,

and among them the best individuals, had only a distrustful smile for

him, while none could explain why the great masters were still in the

right in face of his scruples and objections. And in this painful

condition he found <i>that other spectator,</i> who did not comprehend,

and therefore did not esteem, tragedy. In alliance with him he could

venture, from amid his lonesomeness, to begin the prodigious struggle

against the art of Æschylus and Sophocles&mdash;not with polemic writings,

but as a dramatic poet, who opposed <i>his own</i> conception of tragedy to

the traditional one.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>







<h4>12.</h4>





<p>Before we name this other spectator, let us pause here a moment in

order to recall our own impression, as previously described, of the

discordant and incommensurable elements in the nature of Æschylean

tragedy. Let us think of our own astonishment at the <i>chorus</i> and

the <i>tragic hero</i> of that type of tragedy, neither of which we could

reconcile with our practices any more than with tradition&mdash;till we

rediscovered this duplexity itself as the origin and essence of Greek

tragedy, as the expression of two interwoven artistic impulses, <i>the

Apollonian and the Dionysian</i>.</p>



<p>To separate this primitive and all-powerful Dionysian element from

tragedy, and to build up a new and purified form of tragedy on the

basis of a non-Dionysian art, morality, and conception of things&mdash;such

is the tendency of Euripides which now reveals itself to us in a clear

light.</p>



<p>In a myth composed in the eve of his life, Euripides himself most

urgently propounded to his contemporaries the question as to the

value and signification of this tendency. Is the Dionysian entitled

to exist at all? Should it not be forcibly rooted out of the Hellenic

soil? Certainly, the poet tells us, if only it were possible: but the

god Dionysus is too powerful; his most intelligent adversary&mdash;like

Pentheus in the "Bacchæ"&mdash;is unwittingly enchanted by him, and

in this enchantment meets his fate. The judgment of the two old

sages, Cadmus and Tiresias, seems to be also the judgment of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>

aged poet: that the reflection of the wisest individuals does not

overthrow old popular traditions, nor the perpetually propagating

worship of Dionysus, that in fact it behoves us to display at least a

diplomatically cautious concern in the presence of such strange forces:

where however it is always possible that the god may take offence

at such lukewarm participation, and finally change the diplomat&mdash;in

this case Cadmus&mdash;into a dragon. This is what a poet tells us, who

opposed Dionysus with heroic valour throughout a long life&mdash;in order

finally to wind up his career with a glorification of his adversary,

and with suicide, like one staggering from giddiness, who, in order

to escape the horrible vertigo he can no longer endure, casts himself

from a tower. This tragedy&mdash;the Bacchæ&mdash;is a protest against the

practicability of his own tendency; alas, and it has already been

put into practice! The surprising thing had happened: when the poet

recanted, his tendency had already conquered. Dionysus had already

been scared from the tragic stage, and in fact by a demonic power

which spoke through Euripides. Even Euripides was, in a certain sense,

only a mask: the deity that spoke through him was neither Dionysus nor

Apollo, but an altogether new-born demon, called <i>Socrates.</i> This is

the new antithesis: the Dionysian and the Socratic, and the art-work of

Greek tragedy was wrecked on it. What if even Euripides now seeks to

comfort us by his recantation? It is of no avail: the most magnificent

temple lies in ruins. What avails the lamentation of the destroyer,

and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> confession that it was the most beautiful of all temples? And

even that Euripides has been changed into a dragon as a punishment by

the art-critics of all ages&mdash;who could be content with this wretched

compensation?</p>



<p>Let us now approach this <i>Socratic</i> tendency with which Euripides

combated and vanquished Æschylean tragedy.</p>



<p>We must now ask ourselves, what could be the ulterior aim of the

Euripidean design, which, in the highest ideality of its execution,

would found drama exclusively on the non-Dionysian? What other form of

drama could there be, if it was not to be born of the womb of music, in

the mysterious twilight of the Dionysian? Only <i>the dramatised epos:</i>

in which Apollonian domain of art the <i>tragic</i> effect is of course

unattainable. It does not depend on the subject-matter of the events

here represented; indeed, I venture to assert that it would have been

impossible for Goethe in his projected "Nausikaa" to have rendered

tragically effective the suicide of the idyllic being with which he

intended to complete the fifth act; so extraordinary is the power of

the epic-Apollonian representation, that it charms, before our eyes,

the most terrible things by the joy in appearance and in redemption

through appearance. The poet of the dramatised epos cannot completely

blend with his pictures any more than the epic rhapsodist. He is still

just the calm, unmoved embodiment of Contemplation whose wide eyes see

the picture <i>before</i> them. The actor in this dramatised epos still

remains intrinsically rhapsodist: the consecration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> of inner dreaming

is on all his actions, so that he is never wholly an actor.</p>



<p>How, then, is the Euripidean play related to this ideal of the

Apollonian drama? Just as the younger rhapsodist is related to the

solemn rhapsodist of the old time. The former describes his own

character in the Platonic "Ion" as follows: "When I am saying anything

sad, my eyes fill with tears; when, however, what I am saying is awful

and terrible, then my hair stands on end through fear, and my heart

leaps." Here we no longer observe anything of the epic absorption

in appearance, or of the unemotional coolness of the true actor,

who precisely in his highest activity is wholly appearance and joy

in appearance. Euripides is the actor with leaping heart, with hair

standing on end; as Socratic thinker he designs the plan, as passionate

actor he executes it. Neither in the designing nor in the execution is

he an artist pure and simple. And so the Euripidean drama is a thing

both cool and fiery, equally capable of freezing and burning; it is

impossible for it to attain the Apollonian, effect of the epos, while,

on the other hand, it has severed itself as much as possible from

Dionysian elements, and now, in order to act at all, it requires new

stimulants, which can no longer lie within the sphere of the two unique

art-impulses, the Apollonian and the Dionysian. The stimulants are

cool, paradoxical <i>thoughts</i>, in place of Apollonian intuitions&mdash;and

fiery <i>passions</i>&mdash;in place Dionysean ecstasies; and in fact, thoughts

and passions very realistically copied, and not at all steeped in the

ether of art.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>



<p>Accordingly, if we have perceived this much, that Euripides did not

succeed in establishing the drama exclusively on the Apollonian, but

that rather his non-Dionysian inclinations deviated into a naturalistic

and inartistic tendency, we shall now be able to approach nearer to

the character <i>æsthetic Socratism.</i> supreme law of which reads about

as follows: "to be beautiful everything must be intelligible," as

the parallel to the Socratic proposition, "only the knowing is one

virtuous." With this canon in his hands Euripides measured all the

separate elements of the drama, and rectified them according to his

principle: the language, the characters, the dramaturgic structure, and

the choric music. The poetic deficiency and retrogression, which we

are so often wont to impute to Euripides in comparison with Sophoclean

tragedy, is for the most part the product of this penetrating critical

process, this daring intelligibility. The Euripidian <i>prologue</i> may

serve us as an example of the productivity of this, rationalistic

method. Nothing could be more opposed to the technique of our stage

than the prologue in the drama of Euripides. For a single person to

appear at the outset of the play telling us who he is, what precedes

the action, what has happened thus far, yea, what will happen in

the course of the play, would be designated by a modern playwright

as a wanton and unpardonable abandonment of the effect of suspense.

Everything that is about to happen is known beforehand; who then

cares to wait for it actually to happen?&mdash;considering, moreover, that

here there is not by any means the exciting relation of a predicting

dream to a reality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> taking place later on. Euripides speculated quite

differently. The effect of tragedy never depended on epic suspense, on

the fascinating uncertainty as to what is to happen now and afterwards:

but rather on the great rhetoro-lyric scenes in which the passion and

dialectics of the chief hero swelled to a broad and mighty stream.

Everything was arranged for pathos, not for action: and whatever

was not arranged for pathos was regarded as objectionable. But what

interferes most with the hearer's pleasurable satisfaction in such

scenes is a missing link, a gap in the texture of the previous history.

So long as the spectator has to divine the meaning of this or that

person, or the presuppositions of this or that conflict of inclinations

and intentions, his complete absorption in the doings and sufferings

of the chief persons is impossible, as is likewise breathless

fellow-feeling and fellow-fearing. The Æschyleo-Sophoclean tragedy

employed the most ingenious devices in the first scenes to place in

the hands of the spectator as if by chance all the threads requisite

for understanding the whole: a trait in which that noble artistry is

approved, which as it were masks the <i>inevitably</i> formal, and causes

it to appear as something accidental. But nevertheless Euripides

thought he observed that during these first scenes the spectator was

in a strange state of anxiety to make out the problem of the previous

history, so that the poetic beauties and pathos of the exposition

were lost to him. Accordingly he placed the prologue even before the

exposition, and put it in the mouth of a person who could be trusted:

some deity had often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> as it were to guarantee the particulars of the

tragedy to the public and remove every doubt as to the reality of the

myth: as in the case of Descartes, who could only prove the reality

of the empiric world by an appeal to the truthfulness of God and His

inability to utter falsehood. Euripides makes use of the same divine

truthfulness once more at the close of his drama, in order to ensure to

the public the future of his heroes; this is the task of the notorious

<i>deus ex machina.</i> Between the preliminary and the additional epic

spectacle there is the dramatico-lyric present, the "drama" proper.</p>



<p>Thus Euripides as a poet echoes above all his own conscious

knowledge; and it is precisely on this account that he occupies such

a notable position in the history of Greek art. With reference to his

critico-productive activity, he must often have felt that he ought

to actualise in the drama the words at the beginning of the essay of

Anaxagoras: "In the beginning all things were mixed together; then

came the understanding and created order." And if Anaxagoras with his

"νοῡς" seemed like the first sober person among nothing but drunken

philosophers, Euripides may also have conceived his relation to

the other tragic poets under a similar figure. As long as the sole

ruler and disposer of the universe, the νοῡς, was still excluded

from artistic activity, things were all mixed together in a chaotic,

primitive mess;&mdash;it is thus Euripides was obliged to think, it is thus

he was obliged to condemn the "drunken" poets as the first "sober" one

among them. What Sophocles said of Æschylus, that he did what was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>

right, though unconsciously, was surely not in the mind of Euripides:

who would have admitted only thus much, that Æschylus, <i>because</i> he

wrought unconsciously, did what was wrong. So also the divine Plato

speaks for the most part only ironically of the creative faculty of the

poet, in so far as it is not conscious insight, and places it on a par

with the gift of the soothsayer and dream-interpreter; insinuating that

the poet is incapable of composing until he has become unconscious and

reason has deserted him. Like Plato, Euripides undertook to show to the

world the reverse of the "unintelligent" poet; his æsthetic principle

that "to be beautiful everything must be known" is, as I have said,

the parallel to the Socratic "to be good everything must be known."

Accordingly we may regard Euripides as the poet of æsthetic Socratism.

Socrates, however, was that <i>second spectator</i> who did not comprehend

and therefore did not esteem the Old Tragedy; in alliance with him

Euripides ventured to be the herald of a new artistic activity. If,

then, the Old Tragedy was here destroyed, it follows that æsthetic

Socratism was the murderous principle; but in so far as the struggle is

directed against the Dionysian element in the old art, we recognise in

Socrates the opponent of Dionysus, the new Orpheus who rebels against

Dionysus; and although destined to be torn to pieces by the Mænads of

the Athenian court, yet puts to flight the overpowerful god himself,

who, when he fled from Lycurgus, the king of Edoni, sought refuge in

the depths of the ocean&mdash;namely, in the mystical flood of a secret

cult which gradually overspread the earth.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>







<h4>13.</h4>





<p>That Socrates stood in close relationship to Euripides in the tendency

of his teaching, did not escape the notice of contemporaneous

antiquity; the most eloquent expression of this felicitous insight

being the tale current in Athens, that Socrates was accustomed to help

Euripides in poetising. Both names were mentioned in one breath by the

adherents of the "good old time," whenever they came to enumerating the

popular agitators of the day: to whose influence they attributed the

fact that the old Marathonian stalwart capacity of body and soul was

more and more being sacrificed to a dubious enlightenment, involving

progressive degeneration of the physical and mental powers. It is in

this tone, half indignantly and half contemptuously, that Aristophanic

comedy is wont to speak of both of them&mdash;to the consternation of

modern men, who would indeed be willing enough to give up Euripides,

but cannot suppress their amazement that Socrates should appear in

Aristophanes as the first and head <i>sophist,</i> as the mirror and epitome

of all sophistical tendencies; in connection with which it offers the

single consolation of putting Aristophanes himself in the pillory, as a

rakish, lying Alcibiades of poetry. Without here defending the profound

instincts of Aristophanes against such attacks, I shall now indicate,

by means of the sentiments of the time, the close connection between

Socrates and Euripides. With this purpose in view, it is especially to

be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> remembered that Socrates, as an opponent of tragic art, did not

ordinarily patronise tragedy, but only appeared among the spectators

when a new play of Euripides was performed. The most noted thing,

however, is the close juxtaposition of the two names in the Delphic

oracle, which designated Socrates as the wisest of men, but at the same

time decided that the second prize in the contest of wisdom was due to

Euripides.</p>



<p>Sophocles was designated as the third in this scale of rank; he who

could pride himself that, in comparison with Æschylus, he did what

was right, and did it, moreover, because he <i>knew</i> what was right. It

is evidently just the degree of clearness of this <i>knowledge,</i> which

distinguishes these three men in common as the three "knowing ones" of

their age.</p>



<p>The most decisive word, however, for this new and unprecedented

esteem of knowledge and insight was spoken by Socrates when he

found that he was the only one who acknowledged to himself that he

<i>knew nothing</i> while in his critical pilgrimage through Athens, and

calling on the greatest statesmen, orators, poets, and artists, he

discovered everywhere the conceit of knowledge. He perceived, to his

astonishment, that all these celebrities were without a proper and

accurate insight, even with regard to their own callings, and practised

them only by instinct. "Only by instinct": with this phrase we touch

upon the heart and core of the Socratic tendency. Socratism condemns

therewith existing art as well as existing ethics; wherever Socratism

turns its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> searching eyes it beholds the lack of insight and the

power of illusion; and from this lack infers the inner perversity and

objectionableness of existing conditions. From this point onwards,

Socrates believed that he was called upon to, correct existence;

and, with an air of disregard and superiority, as the precursor

of an altogether different culture, art, and morality, he enters

single-handed into a world, of which, if we reverently touched the hem,

we should count it our greatest happiness.</p>



<p>Here is the extraordinary hesitancy which always seizes upon us with

regard to Socrates, and again and again invites us to ascertain the

sense and purpose of this most questionable phenomenon of antiquity.

Who is it that ventures single-handed to disown the Greek character,

which, as Homer, Pindar, and Æschylus, as Phidias, as Pericles, as

Pythia and Dionysus, as the deepest abyss and the highest height, is

sure of our wondering admiration? What demoniac power is it which would

presume to spill this magic draught in the dust? What demigod is it to

whom the chorus of spirits of the noblest of mankind must call out:

"Weh! Weh! Du hast sie zerstört, die schöne Welt, mit mächtiger Faust;

sie stürzt, sie zerfällt!"<a name="FNanchor_17_19" id="FNanchor_17_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_19" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>



<p>A key to the character of Socrates is presented to us by the surprising

phenomenon designated as the "daimonion" of Socrates. In special

circumstances, when his gigantic intellect began to stagger, he got

a secure support in the utterances of a divine voice which then

spake to him. This voice, whenever it comes, always <i>dissuades.</i>

In this totally abnormal nature instinctive wisdom only appears in

order to hinder the progress of conscious perception here and there.

While in all productive men it is instinct which is the creatively

affirmative force, consciousness only comporting itself critically

and dissuasively; with Socrates it is instinct which becomes critic;

it is consciousness which becomes creator&mdash;a perfect monstrosity

<i>per defectum!</i> And we do indeed observe here a monstrous <i>defectus</i>

of all mystical aptitude, so that Socrates might be designated as

the specific <i>non-mystic,</i> in whom the logical nature is developed,

through a superfoetation, to the same excess as instinctive wisdom

is developed in the mystic. On the other hand, however, the logical

instinct which appeared in Socrates was absolutely prohibited from

turning against itself; in its unchecked flow it manifests a native

power such as we meet with, to our shocking surprise, only among the

very greatest instinctive forces. He who has experienced even a breath

of the divine naïveté and security of the Socratic course of life in

the Platonic writings, will also feel that the enormous driving-wheel

of logical Socratism is in motion, as it were, <i>behind</i> Socrates, and

that it must be viewed through Socrates as through a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> shadow. And

that he himself had a boding of this relation is apparent from the

dignified earnestness with which he everywhere, and even before his

judges, insisted on his divine calling. To refute him here was really

as impossible as to approve of his instinct-disintegrating influence.

In view of this indissoluble conflict, when he had at last been brought

before the forum of the Greek state, there was only one punishment

demanded, namely exile; he might have been sped across the borders as

something thoroughly enigmatical, irrubricable and inexplicable, and so

posterity would have been quite unjustified in charging the Athenians

with a deed of ignominy. But that the sentence of death, and not mere

exile, was pronounced upon him, seems to have been brought about by

Socrates himself, with perfect knowledge of the circumstances, and

without the natural fear of death: he met his death with the calmness

with which, according to the description of Plato, he leaves the

symposium at break of day, as the last of the revellers, to begin a new

day; while the sleepy companions remain behind on the benches and the

floor, to dream of Socrates, the true eroticist. <i>The dying Socrates</i>

became the new ideal of the noble Greek youths,&mdash;an ideal they had

never yet beheld,&mdash;and above all, the typical Hellenic youth, Plato,

prostrated himself before this scene with all the fervent devotion of

his visionary soul.</p>

<h4>14.</h4>





<p>Let us now imagine the one great Cyclopean eye of Socrates fixed on

tragedy, that eye in which the fine frenzy of artistic enthusiasm had

never glowed&mdash;let us think how it was denied to this eye to gaze with

pleasure into the Dionysian abysses&mdash;what could it not but see in the

"sublime and greatly lauded" tragic art, as Plato called it? Something

very absurd, with causes that seemed to be without effects, and

effects apparently without causes; the whole, moreover, so motley and

diversified that it could not but be repugnant to a thoughtful mind, a

dangerous incentive, however, to sensitive and irritable souls. We know

what was the sole kind of poetry which he comprehended: the <i>Æsopian

fable</i>: and he did this no doubt with that smiling complaisance with

which the good honest Gellert sings the praise of poetry in the fable

of the bee and the hen:&mdash;</p>



<p style="margin-left: 10%;">

"Du siehst an mir, wozu sie nützt,<br />

Dem, der nicht viel Verstand besitzt,<br />

Die Wahrheit durch ein Bild zu sagen."<a name="FNanchor_18_20" id="FNanchor_18_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_20" class="fnanchor">[18]</a><br />

</p>



<p>But then it seemed to Socrates that tragic art did not even "tell the

truth": not to mention the fact that it addresses itself to him who

"hath but little wit"; consequently not to the philosopher: a twofold

reason why it should be avoided. Like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> Plato, he reckoned it among the

seductive arts which only represent the agreeable, not the useful, and

hence he required of his disciples abstinence and strict separation

from such unphilosophical allurements; with such success that the

youthful tragic poet Plato first of all burned his poems to be able to

become a scholar of Socrates. But where unconquerable native capacities

bore up against the Socratic maxims, their power, together with the

momentum of his mighty character, still sufficed to force poetry itself

into new and hitherto unknown channels.</p>



<p>An instance of this is the aforesaid Plato: he, who in the condemnation

of tragedy and of art in general certainly did not fall short of

the naïve cynicism of his master, was nevertheless constrained by

sheer artistic necessity to create a form of art which is inwardly

related even to the then existing forms of art which he repudiated.

Plato's main objection to the old art&mdash;that it is the imitation of

a phantom,<a name="FNanchor_19_21" id="FNanchor_19_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_21" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and hence belongs to a sphere still lower than the

empiric world&mdash;could not at all apply to the new art: and so we find

Plato endeavouring to go beyond reality and attempting to represent

the idea which underlies this pseudo-reality. But Plato, the thinker,

thereby arrived by a roundabout road just at the point where he had

always been at home as poet, and from which Sophocles and all the old

artists had solemnly protested against that objection. If tragedy

absorbed into itself all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> earlier varieties of art, the same

could again be said in an unusual sense of Platonic dialogue, which,

engendered by a mixture of all the then existing forms and styles,

hovers midway between narrative, lyric and drama, between prose and

poetry, and has also thereby broken loose from the older strict law

of unity of linguistic form; a movement which was carried still

farther by the <i>cynic</i> writers, who in the most promiscuous style,

oscillating to and fro betwixt prose and metrical forms, realised also

the literary picture of the "raving Socrates" whom they were wont to

represent in life. Platonic dialogue was as it were the boat in which

the shipwrecked ancient poetry saved herself together with all her

children: crowded into a narrow space and timidly obsequious to the

one steersman, Socrates, they now launched into a new world, which

never tired of looking at the fantastic spectacle of this procession.

In very truth, Plato has given to all posterity the prototype of a new

form of art, the prototype of the <i>novel</i> which must be designated as

the infinitely evolved Æsopian fable, in which poetry holds the same

rank with reference to dialectic philosophy as this same philosophy

held for many centuries with reference to theology: namely, the rank of

<i>ancilla.</i> This was the new position of poetry into which Plato forced

it under the pressure of the demon-inspired Socrates.</p>



<p>Here <i>philosophic thought</i> overgrows art and compels it to cling close

to the trunk of dialectics. The <i>Apollonian</i> tendency has chrysalised

in the logical schematism; just as something analogous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> in the case

of Euripides (and moreover a translation of the <i>Dionysian</i> into the

naturalistic emotion) was forced upon our attention. Socrates, the

dialectical hero in Platonic drama, reminds us of the kindred nature

of the Euripidean hero, who has to defend his actions by arguments and

counter-arguments, and thereby so often runs the risk of forfeiting

our tragic pity; for who could mistake the <i>optimistic</i> element

in the essence of dialectics, which celebrates a jubilee in every

conclusion, and can breathe only in cool clearness and consciousness:

the optimistic element, which, having once forced its way into tragedy,

must gradually overgrow its Dionysian regions, and necessarily impel it

to self-destruction&mdash;even to the death-leap into the bourgeois drama.

Let us but realise the consequences of the Socratic maxims: "Virtue is

knowledge; man only sins from ignorance; he who is virtuous is happy":

these three fundamental forms of optimism involve the death of tragedy.

For the virtuous hero must now be a dialectician; there must now be a

necessary, visible connection between virtue and knowledge, between

belief and morality; the transcendental justice of the plot in Æschylus

is now degraded to the superficial and audacious principle of poetic

justice with its usual <i>deus ex machina</i>.</p>



<p>How does the <i>chorus,</i> and, in general, the entire Dionyso-musical

substratum of tragedy, now appear in the light of this new

Socrato-optimistic stage-world? As something accidental, as a readily

dispensable reminiscence of the origin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> of tragedy; while we have

in fact seen that the chorus can be understood only as the cause of

tragedy, and of the tragic generally. This perplexity with respect to

the chorus first manifests itself in Sophocles&mdash;an important sign that

the Dionysian basis of tragedy already begins to disintegrate with

him. He no longer ventures to entrust to the chorus the main share

of the effect, but limits its sphere to such an extent that it now

appears almost co-ordinate with the actors, just as if it were elevated

from the orchestra into the scene: whereby of course its character

is completely destroyed, notwithstanding that Aristotle countenances

this very theory of the chorus. This alteration of the position of

the chorus, which Sophocles at any rate recommended by his practice,

and, according to tradition, even by a treatise, is the first step

towards the <i>annihilation</i> of the chorus, the phases of which follow

one another with alarming rapidity in Euripides, Agathon, and the New

Comedy. Optimistic dialectics drives, <i>music</i> out of tragedy with the

scourge of its syllogisms: that is, it destroys the essence of tragedy,

which can be explained only as a manifestation and illustration of

Dionysian states, as the visible symbolisation of music, as the

dream-world of Dionysian ecstasy.</p>



<p>If, therefore, we are to assume an anti-Dionysian tendency operating

even before Socrates, which received in him only an unprecedentedly

grand expression, we must not shrink from the question as to what

a phenomenon like that of Socrates indicates: whom in view of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>

Platonic dialogues we are certainly not entitled to regard as a purely

disintegrating, negative power. And though there can be no doubt

whatever that the most immediate effect of the Socratic impulse tended

to the dissolution of Dionysian tragedy, yet a profound experience of

Socrates' own life compels us to ask whether there is <i>necessarily</i>

only an antipodal relation between Socratism and art, and whether the

birth of an "artistic Socrates" is in general something contradictory

in itself.</p>



<p>For that despotic logician had now and then the feeling of a gap, or

void, a sentiment of semi-reproach, as of a possibly neglected duty

with respect to art. There often came to him, as he tells his friends

in prison, one and the same dream-apparition, which kept constantly

repeating to him: "Socrates, practise music." Up to his very last days

he solaces himself with the opinion that his philosophising is the

highest form of poetry, and finds it hard to believe that a deity will

remind him of the "common, popular music." Finally, when in prison,

he consents to practise also this despised music, in order thoroughly

to unburden his conscience. And in this frame of mind he composes

a poem on Apollo and turns a few Æsopian fables into verse. It was

something similar to the demonian warning voice which urged him to

these practices; it was because of his Apollonian insight that, like a

barbaric king, he did not understand the noble image of a god and was

in danger of sinning against a deity&mdash;through ignorance. The prompting

voice of the Socratic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> dream-vision is the only sign of doubtfulness

as to the limits of logical nature. "Perhaps "&mdash;thus he had to ask

himself&mdash;"what is not intelligible to me is not therefore unreasonable?

Perhaps there is a realm of wisdom from which the logician is banished?

Perhaps art is even a necessary correlative of and supplement to

science?"</p>

<h4>15.</h4>





<p>In the sense of these last portentous questions it must now be

indicated how the influence of Socrates (extending to the present

moment, indeed, to all futurity) has spread over posterity like an

ever-increasing shadow in the evening sun, and how this influence

again and again necessitates a regeneration of <i>art,</i>&mdash;yea, of art

already with metaphysical, broadest and profoundest sense,&mdash;and its own

eternity guarantees also the eternity of art.</p>



<p>Before this could be perceived, before the intrinsic dependence of

every art on the Greeks, the Greeks from Homer to Socrates, was

conclusively demonstrated, it had to happen to us with regard to these

Greeks as it happened to the Athenians with regard to Socrates. Nearly

every age and stage of culture has at some time or other sought with

deep displeasure to free itself from the Greeks, because in their

presence everything self-achieved, sincerely admired and apparently

quite original, seemed all of a sudden to lose life and colour

and shrink to an abortive copy, even to caricature. And so hearty

indignation breaks forth time after time against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> this presumptuous

little nation, which dared to designate as "barbaric" for all time

everything not native: who are they, one asks one's self, who, though

they possessed only an ephemeral historical splendour, ridiculously

restricted institutions, a dubious excellence in their customs, and

were even branded with ugly vices, yet lay claim to the dignity and

singular position among the peoples to which genius is entitled among

the masses. What a pity one has not been so fortunate as to find the

cup of hemlock with which such an affair could be disposed of without

ado: for all the poison which envy, calumny, and rankling resentment

engendered within themselves have not sufficed to destroy that

self-sufficient grandeur! And so one feels ashamed and afraid in the

presence of the Greeks: unless one prize truth above all things, and

dare also to acknowledge to one's self this truth, that the Greeks,

as charioteers, hold in their hands the reins of our own and of

every culture, but that almost always chariot and horses are of too

poor material and incommensurate with the glory of their guides, who

then will deem it sport to run such a team into an abyss: which they

themselves clear with the leap of Achilles.</p>



<p>In order to assign also to Socrates the dignity of such a leading

position, it will suffice to recognise in him the type of an unheard-of

form of existence, the type of the <i>theoretical man,</i> with regard

to whose meaning and purpose it will be our next task to attain

an insight. Like the artist, the theorist also finds an infinite

satisfaction in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> what <i>is</i> and, like the former, he is shielded by this

satisfaction from the practical ethics of pessimism with its lynx eyes

which shine only in the dark. For if the artist in every unveiling

of truth always cleaves with raptured eyes only to that which still

remains veiled after the unveiling, the theoretical man, on the other

hand, enjoys and contents himself with the cast-off veil, and finds

the consummation of his pleasure in the process of a continuously

successful unveiling through his own unaided efforts. There would

have been no science if it had only been concerned about that <i>one</i>

naked goddess and nothing else. For then its disciples would have been

obliged to feel like those who purposed to dig a hole straight through

the earth: each one of whom perceives that with the utmost lifelong

exertion he is able to excavate only a very little of the enormous

depth, which is again filled up before his eyes by the labours of his

successor, so that a third man seems to do well when on his own account

he selects a new spot for his attempts at tunnelling. If now some one

proves conclusively that the antipodal goal cannot be attained in this

direct way, who will still care to toil on in the old depths, unless he

has learned to content himself in the meantime with finding precious

stones or discovering natural laws? For that reason Lessing, the most

honest theoretical man, ventured to say that he cared more for the

search after truth than for truth itself: in saying which he revealed

the fundamental secret of science, to the astonishment, and indeed,

to the vexation of scientific men. Well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> to be sure, there stands

alongside of this detached perception, as an excess of honesty, if not

of presumption, a profound <i>illusion</i> which first came to the world

in the person of Socrates, the imperturbable belief that, by means

of the clue of causality, thinking reaches to the deepest abysses of

being, and that thinking is able not only to perceive being but even

to <i>correct</i> it. This sublime metaphysical illusion is added as an

instinct to science and again and again leads the latter to its limits,

where it must change into <i>art; which is really the end, to be attained

by this mechanism</i>.</p>



<p>If we now look at Socrates in the light of this thought, he appears to

us as the first who could not only live, but&mdash;what is far more&mdash;also

die under the guidance of this instinct of science: and hence the

picture of the <i>dying, Socrates</i>, as the man delivered from the fear of

death by knowledge and argument, is the escutcheon, above the entrance

to science which reminds every one of its mission, namely, to make

existence appear to be comprehensible, and therefore to be justified:

for which purpose, if arguments do not suffice, <i>myth</i> also must be

used, which I just now designated even as the necessary consequence,

yea, as the end of science.</p>



<p>He who once makes intelligible to himself how, after the death of

Socrates, the mystagogue of science, one philosophical school succeeds

another, like wave upon wave,&mdash;how an entirely unfore-shadowed

universal development of the thirst for knowledge in the widest

compass of the cultured world (and as the specific task for every

one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> highly gifted) led science on to the high sea from which since

then it has never again been able to be completely ousted; how

through the universality of this movement a common net of thought

was first stretched over the entire globe, with prospects, moreover,

of conformity to law in an entire solar system;&mdash;he who realises all

this, together with the amazingly high pyramid of our present-day

knowledge, cannot fail to see in Socrates the turning-point and vortex

of so-called universal history. For if one were to imagine the whole

incalculable sum of energy which has been used up by that universal

tendency,&mdash;employed, <i>not</i> in the service of knowledge, but for the

practical, <i>i.e.,</i> egoistical ends of individuals and peoples,&mdash;then

probably the instinctive love of life would be so much weakened in

universal wars of destruction and incessant migrations of peoples,

that, owing to the practice of suicide, the individual would perhaps

feel the last remnant of a sense of duty, when, like the native of

the Fiji Islands, as son he strangles his parents and, as friend, his

friend: a practical pessimism which might even give rise to a horrible

ethics of general slaughter out of pity&mdash;which, for the rest, exists

and has existed wherever art in one form or another, especially as

science and religion, has not appeared as a remedy and preventive of

that pestilential breath.</p>



<p>In view of this practical pessimism, Socrates is the archetype of

the theoretical optimist, who in the above-indicated belief in the

fathomableness of the nature of things, attributes to knowledge and

perception the power of a universal medicine, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> sees in error and

evil. To penetrate into the depths of the nature of things, and to

separate true perception from error and illusion, appeared to the

Socratic man the noblest and even the only truly human calling: just as

from the time of Socrates onwards the mechanism of concepts, judgments,

and inferences was prized above all other capacities as the highest

activity and the most admirable gift of nature. Even the sublimest

moral acts, the stirrings of pity, of self-sacrifice, of heroism,

and that tranquillity of soul, so difficult of attainment, which the

Apollonian Greek called Sophrosyne, were derived by Socrates, and his

like-minded successors up to the present day, from the dialectics of

knowledge, and were accordingly designated as teachable. He who has

experienced in himself the joy of a Socratic perception, and felt how

it seeks to embrace, in constantly widening circles, the entire world

of phenomena, will thenceforth find no stimulus which could urge him

to existence more forcible than the desire to complete that conquest

and to knit the net impenetrably close. To a person thus minded the

Platonic Socrates then appears as the teacher of an entirely new form

of "Greek cheerfulness" and felicity of existence, which seeks to

discharge itself in actions, and will find its discharge for the most

part in maieutic and pedagogic influences on noble youths, with a view

to the ultimate production of genius.</p>



<p>But now science, spurred on by its powerful illusion, hastens

irresistibly to its limits, on which its optimism, hidden in the

essence of logic, is wrecked. For the periphery of the circle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>

science has an infinite number of points, and while there is still no

telling how this circle can ever be completely measured, yet the noble

and gifted man, even before the middle of his career, inevitably comes

into contact with those extreme points of the periphery where he stares

at the inexplicable. When he here sees to his dismay how logic coils

round itself at these limits and finally bites its own tail&mdash;then the

new form of perception discloses itself, namely <i>tragic perception,</i>

which, in order even to be endured, requires art as a safeguard and

remedy.</p>



<p>If, with eyes strengthened and refreshed at the sight of the Greeks, we

look upon the highest spheres of the world that surrounds us, we behold

the avidity of the insatiate optimistic knowledge, of which Socrates is

the typical representative, transformed into tragic resignation and the

need of art: while, to be sure, this same avidity, in its lower stages,

has to exhibit itself as antagonistic to art, and must especially have

an inward detestation of Dionyso-tragic art, as was exemplified in the

opposition of Socratism to Æschylean tragedy.</p>



<p>Here then with agitated spirit we knock at the gates of the present and

the future: will that "transforming" lead to ever new configurations

of genius, and especially of the <i>music-practising Socrates</i>? Will the

net of art which is spread over existence, whether under the name of

religion or of science, be knit always more closely and delicately,

or is it destined to be torn to shreds under the restlessly barbaric

activity and whirl which is called "the present day"?&mdash;Anxious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> yet

not disconsolate, we stand aloof for a little while, as the spectators

who are permitted to be witnesses of these tremendous struggles and

transitions. Alas! It is the charm of these struggles that he who

beholds them must also fight them!</p>







<h4>16.</h4>





<p>By this elaborate historical example we have endeavoured to make it

clear that tragedy perishes as surely by evanescence of the spirit of

music as it can be born only out of this spirit. In order to qualify

the singularity of this assertion, and, on the other hand, to disclose

the source of this insight of ours, we must now confront with clear

vision the analogous phenomena of the present time; we must enter

into the midst of these struggles, which, as I said just now, are

being carried on in the highest spheres of our present world between

the insatiate optimistic perception and the tragic need of art. In

so doing I shall leave out of consideration all other antagonistic

tendencies which at all times oppose art, especially tragedy, and which

at present again extend their sway triumphantly, to such an extent that

of the theatrical arts only the farce and the ballet, for example, put

forth their blossoms, which perhaps not every one cares to smell, in

tolerably rich luxuriance. I will speak only of the <i>Most Illustrious

Opposition</i> to the tragic conception of things&mdash;and by this I mean

essentially optimistic science, with its ancestor Socrates at the head

of it. Presently also the forces will be designated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span> which seem to me

to guarantee <i>a re-birth of tragedy</i>&mdash;and who knows what other blessed

hopes for the German genius!</p>



<p>Before we plunge into the midst of these struggles, let us array

ourselves in the armour of our hitherto acquired knowledge. In

contrast to all those who are intent on deriving the arts from one

exclusive principle, as the necessary vital source of every work of

art, I keep my eyes fixed on the two artistic deities of the Greeks,

Apollo and Dionysus, and recognise in them the living and conspicuous

representatives of <i>two</i> worlds of art which differ in their intrinsic

essence and in their highest aims. Apollo stands before me as the

transfiguring genius of the <i>principium individuationis</i> through

which alone the redemption in appearance is to be truly attained,

while by the mystical cheer of Dionysus the spell of individuation

is broken, and the way lies open to the Mothers of Being,[20] to the

innermost heart of things. This extraordinary antithesis, which opens

up yawningly between plastic art as the Apollonian and music as the

Dionysian art, has become manifest to only one of the great thinkers,

to such an extent that, even without this key to the symbolism of the

Hellenic divinities, he allowed to music a different character and

origin in advance of all the other arts, because, unlike them, it is

not a copy of the phenomenon, but a direct copy of the will itself, and

therefore represents <i>the metaphysical of everything physical in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>

world</i>, the thing-in-itself of every phenomenon. (Schopenhauer, <i>Welt

als Wille und Vorstellung,</i> I. 310.) To this most important perception

of æsthetics (with which, taken in a serious sense, æsthetics properly

commences), Richard Wagner, by way of confirmation of its eternal

truth, affixed his seal, when he asserted in his <i>Beethoven</i> that

music must be judged according to æsthetic principles quite different

from those which apply to the plastic arts, and not, in general,

according to the category of beauty: although an erroneous æsthetics,

inspired by a misled and degenerate art, has by virtue of the concept

of beauty prevailing in the plastic domain accustomed itself to demand

of music an effect analogous to that of the works of plastic art,

namely the suscitating <i>delight in beautiful forms.</i> Upon perceiving

this extraordinary antithesis, I felt a strong inducement to approach

the essence of Greek tragedy, and, by means of it, the profoundest

revelation of Hellenic genius: for I at last thought myself to be in

possession of a charm to enable me&mdash;far beyond the phraseology of our

usual æsthetics&mdash;to represent vividly to my mind the primitive problem

of tragedy: whereby such an astounding insight into the Hellenic

character was afforded me that it necessarily seemed as if our proudly

comporting classico-Hellenic science had thus far contrived to subsist

almost exclusively on phantasmagoria and externalities.</p>



<p>Perhaps we may lead up to this primitive problem with the question:

what æsthetic effect results when the intrinsically separate

art-powers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> the Apollonian and the Dionysian, enter into concurrent

actions? Or, in briefer form: how is music related to image and

concept?&mdash;Schopenhauer, whom Richard Wagner, with especial reference to

this point, accredits with an unsurpassable clearness and perspicuity

of exposition, expresses himself most copiously on the subject in

the following passage which I shall cite here at full length<a name="FNanchor_21_23" id="FNanchor_21_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_23" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>

(<i>Welt als Wille und Vorstellung,</i> I. p. 309): "According to all

this, we may regard the phenomenal world, or nature, and music as

two different expressions of the same thing,<a name="FNanchor_20_22" id="FNanchor_20_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_22" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> which is therefore

itself the only medium of the analogy between these two expressions,

so that a knowledge of this medium is required in order to understand

that analogy. Music, therefore, if regarded as an expression of the

world, is in the highest degree a universal language, which is related

indeed to the universality of concepts, much as these are related to

the particular things. Its universality, however, is by no means the

empty universality of abstraction, but of quite a different kind, and

is united with thorough and distinct definiteness. In this respect it

resembles geometrical figures and numbers, which are the universal

forms of all possible objiects of experience and applicable to them all

<i>a priori</i>, and yet are not abstract but perceptiple and thoroughly

determinate. All possible efforts, excitements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> and manifestations of

will, all that goes on in the heart of man and that reason includes in

the wide, negative concept of feeling, may be expressed by the infinite

number of possible melodies, but always in the universality of mere

form, without the material, always according to the thing-in-itself,

not the phenomenon,&mdash;of which they reproduce the very soul and essence

as it were, without the body. This deep relation which music bears to

the true nature of all things also explains the fact that suitable

music played to any scene, action, event, or surrounding seems to

disclose to us its most secret meaning, and appears as the most

accurate and distinct commentary upon it; as also the fact that whoever

gives himself up entirely to the impression of a symphony seems to see

all the possible events of life and the world take place in himself:

nevertheless upon reflection he can find no likeness between the music

and the things that passed before his mind. For, as we have said, music

is distinguished from all the other arts by the fact that it is not a

copy of the phenomenon, or, more accurately, the adequate objectivity

of the will, but the direct copy of the will itself, and therefore

represents the metaphysical of everything physical in the world, and

the thing-in-itself of every phenomenon. We might, therefore, just as

well call the world embodied music as embodied will: and this is the

reason why music makes every picture, and indeed every scene of real

life and of the world, at once appear with higher significance; all the

more so, to be sure, in proportion as its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> melody is analogous to the

inner spirit of the given phenomenon. It rests upon this that we are

able to set a poem to music as a song, or a perceptible representation

as a pantomime, or both as an opera. Such particular pictures of human

life, set to the universal language of music, are never bound to it

or correspond to it with stringent necessity, but stand to it only

in the relation of an example chosen at will to a general concept.

In the determinateness of the real they represent that which music

expresses in the universality of mere form. For melodies are to a

certain extent, like general concepts, an abstraction from the actual.

This actual world, then, the world of particular things, affords the

object of perception, the special and the individual, the particular

case, both to the universality of concepts and to the universality of

the melodies. But these two universalities are in a certain respect

opposed to each other; for the concepts contain only the forms, which

are first of all abstracted from perception,&mdash;the separated outward

shell of things, as it were,&mdash;and hence they are, in the strictest

sense of the term, <i>abstracta</i>; music, on the other hand, gives the

inmost kernel which precedes all forms, or the heart of things. This

relation may be very well expressed in the language of the schoolmen,

by saying: the concepts are the <i>universalia post rem,</i> but music gives

the <i>universalia ante rem,</i> and the real world the <i>universalia in

re.</i>&mdash;But that in general a relation is possible between a composition

and a perceptible representation rests, as we have said, upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>

fact that both are simply different expressions of the same inner

being of the world. When now, in the particular case, such a relation

is actually given, that is to say, when the composer has been able to

express in the universal language of music the emotions of will which

constitute the heart of an event, then the melody of the song, the

music of the opera, is expressive. But the analogy discovered by the

composer between the two must have proceeded from the direct knowledge

of the nature of the world unknown to his reason, and must not be an

imitation produced with conscious intention by means of conceptions;

otherwise the music does not express the inner nature of the will

itself, but merely gives an inadequate imitation of its phenomenon: all

specially imitative music does this."</p>



<p>We have therefore, according to the doctrine of Schopenhauer, an

immediate understanding of music as the language of the will, and

feel our imagination stimulated to give form to this invisible and

yet so actively stirred spirit-world which speaks to us, and prompted

to embody it in an analogous example. On the other hand, image and

concept, under the influence of a truly conformable music, acquire a

higher significance. Dionysian art therefore is wont to exercise&mdash;two

kinds of influences, on the Apollonian art-faculty: music firstly

incites to the <i>symbolic intuition</i> of Dionysian universality, and,

secondly, it causes the symbolic image to stand forth <i>in its fullest

significance.</i> From these facts, intelligible in themselves and not

inaccessible to profounder observation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> I infer the capacity of music

to give birth to <i>myth,</i> that is to say, the most significant exemplar,

and precisely <i>tragic</i> myth: the myth which speaks of Dionysian

knowledge in symbols. In the phenomenon of the lyrist, I have set forth

that in him music strives to express itself with regard to its nature

in Apollonian images. If now we reflect that music in its highest

potency must seek to attain also to its highest symbolisation, we must

deem it possible that it also knows how to find the symbolic expression

of its inherent Dionysian wisdom; and where shall we have to seek for

this expression if not in tragedy and, in general, in the conception of

the <i>tragic</i>?</p>



<p>From the nature of art, as it is ordinarily conceived according to

the single category of appearance and beauty, the tragic cannot be

honestly deduced at all; it is only through the spirit of music that

we understand the joy in the annihilation of the individual. For in

the particular examples of such annihilation only is the eternal

phenomenon of Dionysian art made clear to us, which gives expression

to the will in its omnipotence, as it were, behind the <i>principium

individuationis,</i> the eternal life beyond all phenomena, and in

spite of all annihilation. The metaphysical delight in the tragic

is a translation of the instinctively unconscious Dionysian wisdom

into the language of the scene: the hero, the highest manifestation

of the will, is disavowed for our pleasure, because he is only

phenomenon, and because the eternal life of the will is not affected

by his annihilation. "We believe in eternal life,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> tragedy exclaims;

while music is the proximate idea of this life. Plastic art has an

altogether different object: here Apollo vanquishes the suffering of

the individual by the radiant glorification of the <i>eternity of the

phenomenon</i>; here beauty triumphs over the suffering inherent in life;

pain is in a manner surreptitiously obliterated from the features of

nature. In Dionysian art and its tragic symbolism the same nature

speaks to us with its true undissembled voice: "Be as I am! Amidst the

ceaseless change of phenomena the eternally creative primordial mother,

eternally impelling to existence, self-satisfying eternally with this

change of phenomena!"</p>

<h4>17.</h4>





<p>Dionysian art, too, seeks to convince us of the eternal joy of

existence: only we are to seek this joy not in phenomena, but behind

phenomena. We are to perceive how all that comes into being must be

ready for a sorrowful end; we are compelled to look into the terrors of

individual existence&mdash;yet we are not to become torpid: a metaphysical

comfort tears us momentarily from the bustle of the transforming

figures. We are really for brief moments Primordial Being itself,

and feel its indomitable desire for being and joy in existence; the

struggle, the pain, the destruction of phenomena, now appear to us as

something necessary, considering the surplus of innumerable forms of

existence which throng and push one another into life, considering

the exuberant fertility of the universal will. We are pierced by the

maddening sting of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span> these pains at the very moment when we have become,

as it were, one with the immeasurable primordial joy in existence,

and when we anticipate, in Dionysian ecstasy, the indestructibility

and eternity of this joy. In spite of fear and pity, we are the happy

living beings, not as individuals, but as the <i>one</i> living being, with

whose procreative joy we are blended.</p>



<p>The history of the rise of Greek tragedy now tells us with luminous

precision that the tragic art of the Greeks was really born of the

spirit of music: with which conception we believe we have done justice

for the first time to the original and most astonishing significance of

the chorus. At the same time, however, we must admit that the import of

tragic myth as set forth above never became transparent with sufficient

lucidity to the Greek poets, let alone the Greek philosophers; their

heroes speak, as it were, more superficially than they act; the myth

does not at all find its adequate objectification in the spoken word.

The structure of the scenes and the conspicuous images reveal a deeper

wisdom than the poet himself can put into words and concepts: the same

being also observed in Shakespeare, whose Hamlet, for instance, in an

analogous manner talks more superficially than he acts, so that the

previously mentioned lesson of Hamlet is to be gathered not from his

words, but from a more profound contemplation and survey of the whole.

With respect to Greek tragedy, which of course presents itself to us

only as word-drama, I have even intimated that the incongruence between

myth and expression might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> easily tempt us to regard it as shallower

and less significant than it really is, and accordingly to postulate

for it a more superficial effect than it must have had according to

the testimony of the ancients: for how easily one forgets that what

the word-poet did not succeed in doing, namely realising the highest

spiritualisation and ideality of myth, he might succeed in doing

every moment as creative musician! We require, to be sure, almost by

philological method to reconstruct for ourselves the ascendency of

musical influence in order to receive something of the incomparable

comfort which must be characteristic of true tragedy. Even this musical

ascendency, however, would only have been felt by us as such had

we been Greeks: while in the entire development of Greek music&mdash;as

compared with the infinitely richer music known and familiar to us&mdash;we

imagine we hear only the youthful song of the musical genius intoned

with a feeling of diffidence. The Greeks are, as the Egyptian priests

say, eternal children, and in tragic art also they are only children

who do not know what a sublime play-thing has originated under their

hands and&mdash;is being demolished.</p>



<p>That striving of the spirit of music for symbolic and mythical

manifestation, which increases from the beginnings of lyric poetry to

Attic tragedy, breaks off all of a sudden immediately after attaining

luxuriant development, and disappears, as it were, from the surface

of Hellenic art: while the Dionysian view of things born of this

striving lives on in Mysteries and, in its strangest metamorphoses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> and

debasements, does not cease to attract earnest natures. Will it not one

day rise again as art out of its mystic depth?</p>



<p>Here the question occupies us, whether the power by the counteracting

influence of which tragedy perished, has for all time strength enough

to prevent the artistic reawaking of tragedy and of the tragic view

of things. If ancient tragedy was driven from its course by the

dialectical desire for knowledge and the optimism of science, it might

be inferred that there is an eternal conflict between <i>the theoretic</i>

and <i>the tragic view of things,</i> and only after the spirit of science

has been led to its boundaries, and its claim to universal validity

has been destroyed by the evidence of these boundaries, can we hope

for a re-birth of tragedy: for which form of culture we should have to

use the symbol <i>of the music-practising Socrates</i> in the sense spoken

of above. In this contrast, I understand by the spirit of science the

belief which first came to light in the person of Socrates,&mdash;the belief

in the fathomableness of nature and in knowledge as a panacea.</p>



<p>He who recalls the immediate consequences of this restlessly

onward-pressing spirit of science will realise at once that <i>myth</i>

was annihilated by it, and that, in consequence of this annihilation,

poetry was driven as a homeless being from her natural ideal soil.

If we have rightly assigned to music the capacity to reproduce myth

from itself, we may in turn expect to find the spirit of science on

the path where it inimically opposes this mythopoeic power of music.

This takes place in the development of the <i>New Attic Dithyramb,</i> the

music of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span> which no longer expressed the inner essence, the will itself,

but only rendered the phenomenon insufficiently, in an imitation by

means of concepts; from which intrinsically degenerate music the truly

musical natures turned away with the same repugnance that they felt

for the art-destroying tendency of Socrates. The unerring instinct of

Aristophanes surely did the proper thing when it comprised Socrates

himself, the tragedy of Euripides, and the music of the new Dithyrambic

poets in the same feeling of hatred, and perceived in all three

phenomena the symptoms of a degenerate culture. By this New Dithyramb,

music has in an outrageous manner been made the imitative portrait of

phenomena, for instance, of a battle or a storm at sea, and has thus,

of course, been entirely deprived of its mythopoeic power. For if it

endeavours to excite our delight only by compelling us to seek external

analogies between a vital or natural process and certain rhythmical

figures and characteristic sounds of music; if our understanding is

expected to satisfy itself with the perception of these analogies, we

are reduced to a frame of mind in which the reception of the mythical

is impossible; for the myth as a unique exemplar of generality

and truth towering into the infinite, desires to be conspicuously

perceived. The truly Dionysean music presents itself to us as such

a general mirror of the universal will: the conspicuous event which

is refracted in this mirror expands at once for our consciousness to

the copy of an eternal truth. Conversely, such a conspicious event is

at once divested of every mythical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> character by the tone-painting

of the New Dithyramb; music has here become a wretched copy of the

phenomenon, and therefore infinitely poorer than the phenomenon itself:

through which poverty it still further reduces even the phenomenon for

our consciousness, so that now, for instance, a musically imitated

battle of this sort exhausts itself in marches, signal-sounds, etc.,

and our imagination is arrested precisely by these superficialities.

Tone-painting is therefore in every respect the counterpart of true

music with its mythopoeic power: through it the phenomenon, poor in

itself, is made still poorer, while through an isolated Dionysian music

the phenomenon is evolved and expanded into a picture of the world.

It was an immense triumph of the non-Dionysian spirit, when, in the

development of the New Dithyramb, it had estranged music from itself

and reduced it to be the slave of phenomena. Euripides, who, albeit in

a higher sense, must be designated as a thoroughly unmusical nature,

is for this very reason a passionate adherent of the New Dithyrambic

Music, and with the liberality of a freebooter employs all its

effective turns and mannerisms.</p>



<p>In another direction also we see at work the power of this

un-Dionysian, myth-opposing spirit, when we turn our eyes to the

prevalence of <i>character representation</i> and psychological refinement

from Sophocles onwards. The character must no longer be expanded into

an eternal type, but, on the contrary, must operate individually

through artistic by-traits and shadings, through the nicest precision

of all lines, in such a manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> that the spectator is in general no

longer conscious of the myth, but of the mighty nature-myth and the

imitative power of the artist. Here also we observe the victory of

the phenomenon over the Universal, and the delight in the particular

quasi-anatomical preparation; we actually breathe the air of a

theoretical world, in which scientific knowledge is valued more highly

than the artistic reflection of a universal law. The movement along

the line of the representation of character proceeds rapidly: while

Sophocles still delineates complete characters and employs myth for

their refined development, Euripides already delineates only prominent

individual traits of character, which can express themselves in violent

bursts of passion; in the New Attic Comedy, however, there are only

masks with <i>one</i> expression: frivolous old men, duped panders, and

cunning slaves in untiring repetition. Where now is the mythopoeic

spirit of music? What is still left now of music is either excitatory

music or souvenir music, that is, either a stimulant for dull and

used-up nerves, or tone-painting. As regards the former, it hardly

matters about the text set to it: the heroes and choruses of Euripides

are already dissolute enough when once they begin to sing; to what pass

must things have come with his brazen successors?</p>



<p>The new un-Dionysian spirit, however, manifests itself most clearly in

the <i>dénouements</i> of the new dramas. In the Old Tragedy one could feel

at the close the metaphysical comfort, without which the delight in

tragedy cannot be explained at all; the conciliating tones from another

world sound purest,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span> perhaps, in the Œdipus at Colonus. Now that the

genius of music has fled from tragedy, tragedy is, strictly speaking,

dead: for from whence could one now draw the metaphysical comfort? One

sought, therefore, for an earthly unravelment of the tragic dissonance;

the hero, after he had been sufficiently tortured by fate, reaped a

well-deserved reward through a superb marriage or divine tokens of

favour. The hero had turned gladiator, on whom, after being liberally

battered about and covered with wounds, freedom was occasionally

bestowed. The <i>deus ex machina</i> took the place of metaphysical comfort.

I will not say that the tragic view of things was everywhere completely

destroyed by the intruding spirit of the un-Dionysian: we only know

that it was compelled to flee from art into the under-world as it were,

in the degenerate form of a secret cult. Over the widest extent of the

Hellenic character, however, there raged the consuming blast of this

spirit, which manifests itself in the form of "Greek cheerfulness,"

which we have already spoken of as a senile, unproductive love of

existence; this cheerfulness is the counterpart of the splendid

"naïveté" of the earlier Greeks, which, according to the characteristic

indicated above, must be conceived as the blossom of the Apollonian

culture growing out of a dark abyss, as the victory which the Hellenic

will, through its mirroring of beauty, obtains over suffering and the

wisdom of suffering. The noblest manifestation of that other form of

"Greek cheerfulness," the Alexandrine, is the cheerfulness of the

<i>theoretical man</i>: it exhibits the same symptomatic characteristics as

I have just inferred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> concerning the spirit of the un-Dionysian:&mdash;it

combats Dionysian wisdom and art, it seeks to dissolve myth, it

substitutes for metaphysical comfort an earthly consonance, in fact, a

<i>deus ex machina</i> of its own, namely the god of machines and crucibles,

that is, the powers of the genii of nature recognised and employed in

the service of higher egoism; it believes in amending the world by

knowledge, in guiding life by science, and that it can really confine

the individual within a narrow sphere of solvable problems, where he

cheerfully says to life: "I desire thee: it is worth while to know

thee."</p>







<h4>18.</h4>





<p>It is an eternal phenomenon: the avidious will can always, by means

of an illusion spread over things, detain its creatures in life

and compel them to live on. One is chained by the Socratic love of

knowledge and the vain hope of being able thereby to heal the eternal

wound of existence; another is ensnared by art's seductive veil of

beauty fluttering before his eyes; still another by the metaphysical

comfort that eternal life flows on indestructibly beneath the whirl of

phenomena: to say nothing of the more ordinary and almost more powerful

illusions which the will has always at hand. These three specimens of

illusion are on the whole designed only for the more nobly endowed

natures, who in general feel profoundly the weight and burden of

existence, and must be deluded into forgetfulness of their displeasure

by exquisite stimulants. All that we call culture is made up of these

stimulants;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> and, according to the proportion of the ingredients, we

have either a specially <i>Socratic</i> or <i>artistic</i> or <i>tragic culture</i>:

or, if historical exemplifications are wanted, there is either an

Alexandrine or a Hellenic or a Buddhistic culture.</p>



<p>Our whole modern world is entangled in the meshes of Alexandrine

culture, and recognises as its ideal the <i>theorist</i> equipped with

the most potent means of knowledge, and labouring in the service of

science, of whom the archetype and progenitor is Socrates. All our

educational methods have originally this ideal in view: every other

form of existence must struggle onwards wearisomely beside it, as

something tolerated, but not intended. In an almost alarming manner the

cultured man was here found for a long time only in the form of the

scholar: even our poetical arts have been forced to evolve from learned

imitations, and in the main effect of the rhyme we still recognise the

origin of our poetic form from artistic experiments with a non-native

and thoroughly learned language. How unintelligible must <i>Faust,</i> the

modern cultured man, who is in himself intelligible, have appeared to a

true Greek,&mdash;Faust, storming discontentedly through all the faculties,

devoted to magic and the devil from a desire for knowledge, whom we

have only to place alongside of Socrates for the purpose of comparison,

in order to see that modern man begins to divine the boundaries of

this Socratic love of perception and longs for a coast in the wide

waste of the ocean of knowledge. When Goethe on one occasion said to

Eckermann with reference to Napoleon: "Yes, my good friend, there is

also a productiveness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> deeds," he reminded us in a charmingly naïve

manner that the non-theorist is something incredible and astounding to

modern man; so that the wisdom of Goethe is needed once more in order

to discover that such a surprising form of existence is comprehensible,

nay even pardonable.</p>



<p>Now, we must not hide from ourselves what is concealed in the heart

of this Socratic culture: Optimism, deeming itself absolute! Well, we

must not be alarmed if the fruits of this optimism ripen,&mdash;if society,

leavened to the very lowest strata by this kind of culture, gradually

begins to tremble through wanton agitations and desires, if the belief

in the earthly happiness of all, if the belief in the possibility of

such a general intellectual culture is gradually transformed into the

threatening demand for such an Alexandrine earthly happiness, into

the conjuring of a Euripidean <i>deus ex machina.</i> Let us mark this

well: the Alexandrine culture requires a slave class, to be able to

exist permanently: but, in its optimistic view of life, it denies the

necessity of such a class, and consequently, when the effect of its

beautifully seductive and tranquillising utterances about the "dignity

of man" and the "dignity of labour" is spent, it gradually drifts

towards a dreadful destination. There is nothing more terrible than

a barbaric slave class, who have learned to regard their existence

as an injustice, and now prepare to take vengeance, not only for

themselves, but for all generations. In the face of such threatening

storms, who dares to appeal with confident spirit to our pale and

exhausted religions, which even in their foundations have degenerated

into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> scholastic religions?&mdash;so that myth, the necessary prerequisite

of every religion, is already paralysed everywhere, and even in this

domain the optimistic spirit&mdash;which we have just designated as the

annihilating germ of society&mdash;has attained the mastery.</p>



<p>While the evil slumbering in the heart of theoretical culture gradually

begins to disquiet modern man, and makes him anxiously ransack the

stores of his experience for means to avert the danger, though not

believing very much in these means; while he, therefore, begins to

divine the consequences his position involves: great, universally

gifted natures have contrived, with an incredible amount of thought, to

make use of the apparatus of science itself, in order to point out the

limits and the relativity of knowledge generally, and thus definitely

to deny the claim of science to universal validity and universal ends:

with which demonstration the illusory notion was for the first time

recognised as such, which pretends, with the aid of causality, to be

able to fathom the innermost essence of things. The extraordinary

courage and wisdom of <i>Kant</i> and <i>Schopenhauer</i> have succeeded in

gaining the most, difficult, victory, the victory over the optimism

hidden in the essence of logic, which optimism in turn is the basis of

our culture. While this optimism, resting on apparently unobjectionable

<i>æterna veritates,</i> believed in the intelligibility and solvability of

all the riddles of the world, and treated space, time, and causality

as totally unconditioned laws of the most universal validity, Kant, on

the other hand, showed that these served in reality only to elevate the

mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> phenomenon, the work of Mâyâ, to the sole and highest reality,

putting it in place of the innermost and true essence of things, thus

making the actual knowledge of this essence impossible, that is,

according to the expression of Schopenhauer, to lull the dreamer still

more soundly asleep (<i>Welt als Wille und Vorstellung,</i> I. 498). With

this knowledge a culture is inaugurated which I venture to designate as

a tragic culture; the most important characteristic of which is that

wisdom takes the place of science as the highest end,&mdash;wisdom, which,

uninfluenced by the seductive distractions of the sciences, turns

with unmoved eye to the comprehensive view of the world, and seeks to

apprehend therein the eternal suffering as its own with sympathetic

feelings of love. Let us imagine a rising generation with this

undauntedness of vision, with this heroic desire for the prodigious,

let us imagine the bold step of these dragon-slayers, the proud and

daring spirit with which they turn their backs on all the effeminate

doctrines of optimism in order "to live resolutely" in the Whole and in

the Full: would it not be necessary for the tragic man of this culture,

with his self-discipline to earnestness and terror, to desire a new

art, the art of metaphysical comfort,&mdash;namely, tragedy, as the Hellena

belonging to him, and that he should exclaim with Faust:</p>



<p style="margin-left: 10%;">

Und sollt' ich nicht, sehnsüchtigster Gewalt,<br />

In's Leben ziehn die einzigste Gestalt?<a name="FNanchor_21_24" id="FNanchor_21_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_24" class="fnanchor">[21]</a><br />

</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>



<p>But now that the Socratic culture has been shaken from two directions,

and is only able to hold the sceptre of its infallibility with

trembling hands,&mdash;once by the fear of its own conclusions which it at

length begins to surmise, and again, because it is no longer convinced

with its former naïve trust of the eternal validity of its foundation,

&mdash;it is a sad spectacle to behold how the dance of its thought always

rushes longingly on new forms, to embrace them, and then, shuddering,

lets them go of a sudden, as Mephistopheles does the seductive Lamiæ.

It is certainly the symptom of the "breach" which all are wont to speak

of as the primordial suffering of modern culture that the theoretical

man, alarmed and dissatisfied at his own conclusions, no longer dares

to entrust himself to the terrible ice-stream of existence: he runs

timidly up and down the bank. He no longer wants to have anything

entire, with all the natural cruelty of things, so thoroughly has he

been spoiled by his optimistic contemplation. Besides, he feels that

a culture built up on the principles of science must perish when it

begins to grow <i>illogical,</i> that is, to avoid its own conclusions.

Our art reveals this universal trouble: in vain does one seek help by

imitating all the great productive periods and natures, in vain does

one accumulate the entire "world-literature" around modern man for

his comfort, in vain does one place one's self in the midst of the

art-styles and artists of all ages, so that one may give names to them

as Adam did to the beasts: one still continues the eternal hungerer,

the "critic" without joy and energy, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> Alexandrine man, who is in

the main a librarian and corrector of proofs, and who, pitiable wretch

goes blind from the dust of books and printers' errors.</p>

<h4>19.</h4>





<p>We cannot designate the intrinsic substance of Socratic culture more

distinctly than by calling it <i>the culture of the opera</i>: for it is in

this department that culture has expressed itself with special naïveté

concerning its aims and perceptions, which is sufficiently surprising

when we compare the genesis of the opera and the facts of operatic

development with the eternal truths of the Apollonian and Dionysian.

I call to mind first of all the origin of the <i>stilo rappresentativo</i>

and the recitative. Is it credible that this thoroughly externalised

operatic music, incapable of devotion, could be received and cherished

with enthusiastic favour, as a re-birth, as it were, of all true music,

by the very age in which the ineffably sublime and sacred music of

Palestrina had originated? And who, on the other hand, would think of

making only the diversion-craving luxuriousness of those Florentine

circles and the vanity of their dramatic singers responsible for the

love of the opera which spread with such rapidity? That in the same

age, even among the same people, this passion for a half-musical

mode of speech should awaken alongside of the vaulted structure

of Palestrine harmonies which the entire Christian Middle Age had

been building up, I can explain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> to myself only by a co-operating

<i>extra-artistic tendency</i> in the essence of the recitative.</p>



<p>The listener, who insists on distinctly hearing the words under the

music, has his wishes met by the singer in that he speaks rather than

sings, and intensifies the pathetic expression of the words in this

half-song: by this intensification of the pathos he facilitates the

understanding of the words and surmounts the remaining half of the

music. The specific danger which now threatens him is that in some

unguarded moment he may give undue importance to music, which would

forthwith result in the destruction of the pathos of the speech and

the distinctness of the words: while, on the other hand, he always

feels himself impelled to musical delivery and to virtuose exhibition

of vocal talent. Here the "poet" comes to his aid, who knows how to

provide him with abundant opportunities for lyrical interjections,

repetitions of words and sentences, etc.,&mdash;at which places the singer,

now in the purely musical element, can rest himself without minding the

words. This alternation of emotionally impressive, yet only half-sung

speech and wholly sung interjections, which is characteristic of the

<i>stilo rappresentativo,</i> this rapidly changing endeavour to operate

now on the conceptional and representative faculty of the hearer, now

on his musical sense, is something so thoroughly unnatural and withal

so intrinsically contradictory both to the Apollonian and Dionysian

artistic impulses, that one has to infer an origin of the recitative

foreign to all artistic instincts. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> recitative must be defined,

according to this description, as the combination of epic and lyric

delivery, not indeed as an intrinsically stable combination which

could not be attained in the case of such totally disparate elements,

but an entirely superficial mosaic conglutination, such as is totally

unprecedented in the domain of nature and experience. <i>But this was

not the opinion of the inventors of the recitative:</i> they themselves,

and their age with them, believed rather that the mystery of antique

music had been solved by this <i>stilo rappresentativo,</i> in which, as

they thought, the only explanation of the enormous influence of an

Orpheus, an Amphion, and even of Greek tragedy was to be found. The new

style was regarded by them as the re-awakening of the most effective

music, the Old Greek music: indeed, with the universal and popular

conception of the Homeric world <i>as the primitive world,</i> they could

abandon themselves to the dream of having descended once more into the

paradisiac beginnings of mankind, wherein music also must needs have

had the unsurpassed purity, power, and innocence of which the poets

could give such touching accounts in their pastoral plays. Here we see

into the internal process of development of this thoroughly modern

variety of art, the opera: a powerful need here acquires an art, but

it is a need of an unæsthetic kind: the yearning for the idyll, the

belief in the prehistoric existence of the artistic, good man. The

recitative was regarded as the rediscovered language of this primitive

man; the opera as the recovered land of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span> idyllically or heroically

good creature, who in every action follows at the same time a natural

artistic impulse, who sings a little along with all he has to say, in

order to sing immediately with full voice on the slightest emotional

excitement. It is now a matter of indifference to us that the humanists

of those days combated the old ecclesiastical representation of man

as naturally corrupt and lost, with this new-created picture of the

paradisiac artist: so that opera may be understood as the oppositional

dogma of the good man, whereby however a solace was at the same time

found for the pessimism to which precisely the seriously-disposed

men of that time were most strongly incited, owing to the frightful

uncertainty of all conditions of life. It is enough to have perceived

that the intrinsic charm, and therefore the genesis, of this new form

of art lies in the gratification of an altogether unæsthetic need, in

the optimistic glorification of man as such, in the conception of the

primitive man as the man naturally good and artistic: a principle of

the opera which has gradually changed into a threatening and terrible

<i>demand,</i> which, in face of the socialistic movements of the present

time, we can no longer ignore. The "good primitive man" wants his

rights: what paradisiac prospects!</p>



<p>I here place by way of parallel still another equally obvious

confirmation of my view that opera is built up on the same principles

as our Alexandrine culture. Opera is the birth of the theoretical man,

of the critical layman, not of the artist: one of the most surprising

facts in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> whole history of art. It was the demand of thoroughly

unmusical hearers that the words must above all be understood, so

that according to them a re-birth of music is only to be expected

when some mode of singing has been discovered in which the text-word

lords over the counterpoint as the master over the servant. For the

words, it is argued, are as much nobler than the accompanying harmonic

system as the soul is nobler than the body. It was in accordance with

the laically unmusical crudeness of these views that the combination

of music, picture and expression was effected in the beginnings of

the opera: in the spirit of this æsthetics the first experiments

were also made in the leading laic circles of Florence by the poets

and singers patronised there. The man incapable of art creates for

himself a species of art precisely because he is the inartistic man

as such. Because he does not divine the Dionysian depth of music, he

changes his musical taste into appreciation of the understandable

word-and-tone-rhetoric of the passions in the <i>stilo rappresentativo,</i>

and into the voluptuousness of the arts of song; because he is unable

to behold a vision, he forces the machinist and the decorative artist

into his service; because he cannot apprehend the true nature of the

artist, he conjures up the "artistic primitive man" to suit his taste,

that is, the man who sings and recites verses under the influence

of passion. He dreams himself into a time when passion suffices to

generate songs and poems: as if emotion had ever been able to create

anything artistic. The postulate of the opera is a false<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> belief

concerning the artistic process, in fact, the idyllic belief that every

sentient man is an artist. In the sense of this belief, opera is the

expression of the taste of the laity in art, who dictate their laws

with the cheerful optimism of the theorist.</p>



<p>Should we desire to unite in one the two conceptions just set forth

as influential in the origin of opera, it would only remain for us to

speak of an <i>idyllic tendency of the opera</i>: in which connection we

may avail ourselves exclusively of the phraseology and illustration of

Schiller.<a name="FNanchor_22_25" id="FNanchor_22_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_25" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> "Nature and the ideal," he says, "are either objects of

grief, when the former is represented as lost, the latter unattained;

or both are objects of joy, in that they are represented as real.

The first case furnishes the elegy in its narrower signification,

the second the idyll in its widest sense." Here we must at once call

attention to the common characteristic of these two conceptions in

operatic genesis, namely, that in them the ideal is not regarded as

unattained or nature as lost Agreeably to this sentiment, there was

a primitive age of man when he lay close to the heart of nature,

and, owing to this naturalness, had attained the ideal of mankind in

a paradisiac goodness and artist-organisation: from which perfect

primitive man all of us were supposed to be descended; whose faithful

copy we were in fact still said to be: only we had to cast off some

few things in order to recognise ourselves once more as this primitive

man, on the strength of a voluntary renunciation of superfluous

learnedness, of super-abundant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> culture. It was to such a concord of

nature and the ideal, to an idyllic reality, that the cultured man

of the Renaissance suffered himself to be led back by his operatic

imitation of Greek tragedy; he made use of this tragedy, as Dante made

use of Vergil, in order to be led up to the gates of paradise: while

from this point he went on without assistance and passed over from an

imitation of the highest form of Greek art to a "restoration of all

things," to an imitation of man's original art-world. What delightfully

naïve hopefulness of these daring endeavours, in the very heart of

theoretical culture!&mdash;solely to be explained by the comforting belief,

that "man-in-himself" is the eternally virtuous hero of the opera,

the eternally fluting or singing shepherd, who must always in the end

rediscover himself as such, if he has at any time really lost himself;

solely the fruit of the optimism, which here rises like a sweetishly

seductive column of vapour out of the depth of the Socratic conception

of the world.</p>



<p>The features of the opera therefore do not by any means exhibit the

elegiac sorrow of an eternal loss, but rather the cheerfulness of

eternal rediscovery, the indolent delight in an idyllic reality which

one can at least represent to one's self each moment as real: and in

so doing one will perhaps surmise some day that this supposed reality

is nothing but a fantastically silly dawdling, concerning which every

one, who could judge it by the terrible earnestness of true nature

and compare it with the actual primitive scenes of the beginnings of

mankind, would have to call out with loathing: Away with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> the phantom!

Nevertheless one would err if one thought it possible to frighten

away merely by a vigorous shout such a dawdling thing as the opera,

as if it were a spectre. He who would destroy the opera must join

issue with Alexandrine cheerfulness, which expresses itself so naïvely

therein concerning its favourite representation; of which in fact

it is the specific form of art. But what is to be expected for art

itself from the operation of a form of art, the beginnings of which

do not at all lie in the æsthetic province; which has rather stolen

over from a half-moral sphere into the artistic domain, and has been

able only now and then to delude us concerning this hybrid origin? By

what sap is this parasitic opera-concern nourished, if not by that

of true art? Must we not suppose that the highest and indeed the

truly serious task of art&mdash;to free the eye from its glance into the

horrors of night and to deliver the "subject" by the healing balm of

appearance from the spasms of volitional agitations&mdash;will degenerate

under the influence of its idyllic seductions and Alexandrine

adulation to an empty dissipating tendency, to pastime? What will

become of the eternal truths of the Dionysian and Apollonian in such

an amalgamation of styles as I have exhibited in the character of the

<i>stilo rappresentativo</i>? where music is regarded as the servant, the

text as the master, where music is compared with the body, the text

with the soul? where at best the highest aim will be the realisation

of a paraphrastic tone-painting, just as formerly in the New Attic

Dithyramb? where music is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> completely alienated from its true dignity

of being, the Dionysian mirror of the world, so that the only thing

left to it is, as a slave of phenomena, to imitate the formal character

thereof, and to excite an external pleasure in the play of lines and

proportions. On close observation, this fatal influence of the opera

on music is seen to coincide absolutely with the universal development

of modern music; the optimism lurking in the genesis of the opera and

in the essence of culture represented thereby, has, with alarming

rapidity, succeeded in divesting music of its Dionyso-cosmic mission

and in impressing on it a playfully formal and pleasurable character: a

change with which perhaps only the metamorphosis of the Æschylean man

into the cheerful Alexandrine man could be compared.</p>



<p>If, however, in the exemplification herewith indicated we have rightly

associated the evanescence of the Dionysian spirit with a most

striking, but hitherto unexplained transformation and degeneration of

the Hellene&mdash;what hopes must revive in us when the most trustworthy

auspices guarantee <i>the reverse process, the gradual awakening of

the Dionysian spirit</i> in our modern world! It is impossible for the

divine strength of Herakles to languish for ever in voluptuous bondage

to Omphale. Out of the Dionysian root of the German spirit a power

has arisen which has nothing in common with the primitive conditions

of Socratic culture, and can neither be explained nor excused

thereby, but is rather regarded by this culture as something terribly

inexplicable and overwhelmingly hostile,mdash;namely, <i>German music</i> as

we have to understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> it, especially in its vast solar orbit from

Bach to Beethoven, from Beethoven to Wagner. What even under the most

favourable circumstances can the knowledge-craving Socratism of our

days do with this demon rising from unfathomable depths? Neither by

means of the zig-zag and arabesque work of operatic melody, nor with

the aid of the arithmetical counting board of fugue and contrapuntal

dialectics is the formula to be found, in the trebly powerful light<a name="FNanchor_23_26" id="FNanchor_23_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_26" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>

of which one could subdue this demon and compel it to speak. What

a spectacle, when our æsthetes, with a net of "beauty" peculiar to

themselves, now pursue and clutch at the genius of music romping

about before them with incomprehensible life, and in so doing display

activities which are not to be judged by the standard of eternal beauty

any more than by the standard of the sublime. Let us but observe these

patrons of music as they are, at close range, when they call out so

indefatigably "beauty! beauty!" to discover whether they have the marks

of nature's darling children who are fostered and fondled in the lap

of the beautiful, or whether they do not rather seek a disguise for

their own rudeness, an æsthetical pretext for their own unemotional

insipidity: I am thinking here, for instance, of Otto Jahn. But let the

liar and the hypocrite beware of our German music: for in the midst

of all our culture it is really the only genuine, pure and purifying

fire-spirit from which and towards which, as in the teaching of the

great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> Heraclitus of Ephesus, all things move in a double orbit-all

that we now call culture, education, civilisation, must appear some day

before the unerring judge, Dionysus.</p>



<p>Let us recollect furthermore how Kant and Schopenhauer made it

possible for the spirit of <i>German philosophy</i> streaming from the

same sources to annihilate the satisfied delight in existence of

scientific Socratism by the delimitation of the boundaries thereof; how

through this delimitation an infinitely profounder and more serious

view of ethical problems and of art was inaugurated, which we may

unhesitatingly designate as <i>Dionysian</i> wisdom comprised in concepts.

To what then does the mystery of this oneness of German music and

philosophy point, if not to a new form of existence, concerning the

substance of which we can only inform ourselves presentiently from

Hellenic analogies? For to us who stand on the boundary line between

two different forms of existence, the Hellenic prototype retains the

immeasurable value, that therein all these transitions and struggles

are imprinted in a classically instructive form: except that we, as

it were, experience analogically in <i>reverse</i> order the chief epochs

of the Hellenic genius, and seem now, for instance, to pass backwards

from the Alexandrine age to the period of tragedy. At the same time

we have the feeling that the birth of a tragic age betokens only a

return to itself of the German spirit, a blessed self-rediscovering

after excessive and urgent external influences have for a long time

compelled it, living as it did in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> helpless barbaric formlessness, to

servitude under their form. It may at last, after returning to the

primitive source of its being, venture to stalk along boldly and freely

before all nations without hugging the leading-strings of a Romanic

civilisation: if only it can learn implicitly of one people&mdash;the

Greeks, of whom to learn at all is itself a high honour and a rare

distinction. And when did we require these highest of all teachers more

than at present, when we experience <i>a re-birth of tragedy</i> and are in

danger alike of not knowing whence it comes, and of being unable to

make clear to ourselves whither it tends.</p>

<h4>20.</h4>





<p>It may be weighed some day before an impartial judge, in what time and

in what men the German spirit has thus far striven most resolutely to

learn of the Greeks: and if we confidently assume that this unique

praise must be accorded to the noblest intellectual efforts of Goethe,

Schiller, and Winkelmann, it will certainly have to be added that

since their time, and subsequently to the more immediate influences of

these efforts, the endeavour to attain to culture and to the Greeks by

this path has in an incomprehensible manner grown feebler and feebler.

In order not to despair altogether of the German spirit, must we not

infer therefrom that possibly, in some essential matter, even these

champions could not penetrate into the core of the Hellenic nature,

and were unable to establish a permanent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> friendly alliance between

German and Greek culture? So that perhaps an unconscious perception

of this shortcoming might raise also in more serious minds the

disheartening doubt as to whether after such predecessors they could

advance still farther on this path of culture, or could reach the goal

at all. Accordingly, we see the opinions concerning the value of Greek

contribution to culture degenerate since that time in the most alarming

manner; the expression of compassionate superiority may be heard

in the most heterogeneous intellectual and non-intellectual camps,

and elsewhere a totally ineffective declamation dallies with "Greek

harmony," "Greek beauty," "Greek cheerfulness." And in the very circles

whose dignity it might be to draw indefatigably from the Greek channel

for the good of German culture, in the circles of the teachers in the

higher educational institutions, they have learned best to compromise

with the Greeks in good time and on easy terms, to the extent often of

a sceptical abandonment of the Hellenic ideal and a total perversion of

the true purpose of antiquarian studies. If there be any one at all in

these circles who has not completely exhausted himself in the endeavour

to be a trustworthy corrector of old texts or a natural-history

microscopist of language, he perhaps seeks also to appropriate Grecian

antiquity "historically" along with other antiquities, and in any case

according to the method and with the supercilious air of our present

cultured historiography. When, therefore, the intrinsic efficiency

of the higher educational<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> institutions has never perhaps been lower

or feebler than at present, when the "journalist," the paper slave

of the day, has triumphed over the academic teacher in all matters

pertaining to culture, and there only remains to the latter the often

previously experienced metamorphosis of now fluttering also, as a

cheerful cultured butterfly, in the idiom of the journalist, with the

"light elegance" peculiar thereto&mdash;with what painful confusion must the

cultured persons of a period like the present gaze at the phenomenon

(which can perhaps be comprehended analogically only by means of the

profoundest principle of the hitherto unintelligible Hellenic genius)

of the reawakening of the Dionysian spirit and the re-birth of tragedy?

Never has there been another art-period in which so-called culture

and true art have been so estranged and opposed, as is so obviously

the case at present. We understand why so feeble a culture hates true

art; it fears destruction thereby. But must not an entire domain of

culture, namely the Socratic-Alexandrine, have exhausted its powers

after contriving to culminate in such a daintily-tapering point as our

present culture? When it was not permitted to heroes like Goethe and

Schiller to break open the enchanted gate which leads into the Hellenic

magic mountain, when with their most dauntless striving they did not

get beyond the longing gaze which the Goethean Iphigenia cast from

barbaric Tauris to her home across the ocean, what could the epigones

of such heroes hope for, if the gate should not open to them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> suddenly

of its own accord, in an entirely different position, quite overlooked

in all endeavours of culture hitherto&mdash;amidst the mystic tones of

reawakened tragic music.</p>



<p>Let no one attempt to weaken our faith in an impending re-birth of

Hellenic antiquity; for in it alone we find our hope of a renovation

and purification of the German spirit through the fire-magic of music.

What else do we know of amidst the present desolation and languor

of culture, which could awaken any comforting expectation for the

future? We look in vain for one single vigorously-branching root, for

a speck of fertile and healthy soil: there is dust, sand, torpidness

and languishing everywhere! Under such circumstances a cheerless

solitary wanderer could choose for himself no better symbol than the

Knight with Death and the Devil, as Dürer has sketched him for us, the

mail-clad knight, grim and stern of visage, who is able, unperturbed

by his gruesome companions, and yet hopelessly, to pursue his terrible

path with horse and hound alone. Our Schopenhauer was such a Dürerian

knight: he was destitute of all hope, but he sought the truth. There is

not his equal.</p>



<p>But how suddenly this gloomily depicted wilderness of our exhausted

culture changes when the Dionysian magic touches it! A hurricane

seizes everything decrepit, decaying, collapsed, and stunted; wraps

it whirlingly into a red cloud of dust; and carries it like a vulture

into the air. Confused thereby, our glances seek for what has vanished:

for what they see is something risen to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> the golden light as from

a depression, so full and green, so luxuriantly alive, so ardently

infinite. Tragedy sits in the midst of this exuberance of life,

sorrow and joy, in sublime ecstasy; she listens to a distant doleful

song&mdash;it tells of the Mothers of Being, whose names are: <i>Wahn, Wille,

Wehe</i>[21]&mdash;Yes, my friends, believe with me in Dionysian life and

in the re-birth of tragedy. The time of the Socratic man is past:

crown yourselves with ivy, take in your hands the thyrsus, and do not

marvel if tigers and panthers lie down fawning at your feet. Dare now

to be tragic men, for ye are to be redeemed! Ye are to accompany the

Dionysian festive procession from India to Greece! Equip yourselves for

severe conflict, but believe in the wonders of your god!</p>







<h4>21.</h4>





<p>Gliding back from these hortative tones into the mood which befits

the contemplative man, I repeat that it can only be learnt from the

Greeks what such a sudden and miraculous awakening of tragedy must

signify for the essential basis of a people's life. It is the people

of the tragic mysteries who fight the battles with the Persians: and

again, the people who waged such wars required tragedy as a necessary

healing potion. Who would have imagined that there was still such a

uniformly powerful effusion of the simplest political sentiments, the

most natural domestic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> instincts and the primitive manly delight in

strife in this very people after it had been shaken to its foundations

for several generations by the most violent convulsions of the

Dionysian demon? If at every considerable spreading of the Dionysian

commotion one always perceives that the Dionysian loosing from the

shackles of the individual makes itself felt first of all in an

increased encroachment on the political instincts, to the extent of

indifference, yea even hostility, it is certain, on the other hand,

that the state-forming Apollo is also the genius of the <i>principium

individuationis,</i> and that the state and domestic sentiment cannot live

without an assertion of individual personality. There is only one way

from orgasm for a people,&mdash;the way to Indian Buddhism, which, in order

to be at all endured with its longing for nothingness, requires the

rare ecstatic states with their elevation above space, time, and the

individual; just as these in turn demand a philosophy which teaches how

to overcome the indescribable depression of the intermediate states by

means of a fancy. With the same necessity, owing to the unconditional

dominance of political impulses, a people drifts into a path of

extremest secularisation, the most magnificent, but also the most

terrible expression of which is the Roman <i>imperium</i>.</p>



<p>Placed between India and Rome, and constrained to a seductive choice,

the Greeks succeeded in devising in classical purity still a third form

of life, not indeed for long private use, but just on that account for

immortality. For it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> holds true in all things that those whom the gods

love die young, but, on the other hand, it holds equally true that they

then live eternally with the gods. One must not demand of what is most

noble that it should possess the durable toughness of leather; the

staunch durability, which, for instance, was inherent in the national

character of the Romans, does not probably belong to the indispensable

predicates of perfection. But if we ask by what physic it was possible

for the Greeks, in their best period, notwithstanding the extraordinary

strength of their Dionysian and political impulses, neither to exhaust

themselves by ecstatic brooding, nor by a consuming scramble for empire

and worldly honour, but to attain the splendid mixture which we find

in a noble, inflaming, and contemplatively disposing wine, we must

remember the enormous power of <i>tragedy,</i> exciting, purifying, and

disburdening the entire life of a people; the highest value of which

we shall divine only when, as in the case of the Greeks, it appears

to us as the essence of all the prophylactic healing forces, as the

mediator arbitrating between the strongest and most inherently fateful

characteristics of a people.</p>



<p>Tragedy absorbs the highest musical orgasm into itself, so that it

absolutely brings music to perfection among the Greeks, as among

ourselves; but it then places alongside thereof tragic myth and the

tragic hero, who, like a mighty Titan, takes the entire Dionysian world

on his shoulders and disburdens us thereof; while, on the other hand,

it is able by means of this same tragic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> myth, in the person of the

tragic hero, to deliver us from the intense longing for this existence,

and reminds us with warning hand of another existence and a higher

joy, for which the struggling hero prepares himself presentiently by

his destruction, not by his victories. Tragedy sets a sublime symbol,

namely the myth between the universal authority of its music and the

receptive Dionysian hearer, and produces in him the illusion that music

is only the most effective means for the animation of the plastic world

of myth. Relying upon this noble illusion, she can now move her limbs

for the dithyrambic dance, and abandon herself unhesitatingly to an

orgiastic feeling of freedom, in which she could not venture to indulge

as music itself, without this illusion. The myth protects us from the

music, while, on the other hand, it alone gives the highest freedom

thereto. By way of return for this service, music imparts to tragic

myth such an impressive and convincing metaphysical significance as

could never be attained by word and image, without this unique aid;

and the tragic spectator in particular experiences thereby the sure

presentiment of supreme joy to which the path through destruction and

negation leads; so that he thinks he hears, as it were, the innermost

abyss of things speaking audibly to him.</p>



<p>If in these last propositions I have succeeded in giving perhaps only a

preliminary expression, intelligible to few at first, to this difficult

representation, I must not here desist from stimulating my friends to a

further attempt, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> cease from beseeching them to prepare themselves,

by a detached example of our common experience, for the perception of

the universal proposition. In this example I must not appeal to those

who make use of the pictures of the scenic processes, the words and the

emotions of the performers, in order to approximate thereby to musical

perception; for none of these speak music as their mother-tongue,

and, in spite of the aids in question, do not get farther than the

precincts of musical perception, without ever being allowed to touch

its innermost shrines; some of them, like Gervinus, do not even reach

the precincts by this path. I have only to address myself to those

who, being immediately allied to music, have it as it were for their

mother's lap, and are connected with things almost exclusively by

unconscious musical relations. I ask the question of these genuine

musicians: whether they can imagine a man capable of hearing the third

act of <i>Tristan und Isolde</i> without any aid of word or scenery, purely

as a vast symphonic period, without expiring by a spasmodic distention

of all the wings of the soul? A man who has thus, so to speak, put his

ear to the heart-chamber of the cosmic will, who feels the furious

desire for existence issuing therefrom as a thundering stream or most

gently dispersed brook, into all the veins of the world, would he not

collapse all at once? Could he endure, in the wretched fragile tenement

of the human individual, to hear the re-echo of countless cries of

joy and sorrow from the "vast void of cosmic night," without flying

irresistibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> towards his primitive home at the sound of this pastoral

dance-song of metaphysics? But if, nevertheless, such a work can be

heard as a whole, without a renunciation of individual existence, if

such a creation could be created without demolishing its creator&mdash;where

are we to get the solution of this contradiction?</p>



<p>Here there interpose between our highest musical excitement and the

music in question the tragic myth and the tragic hero&mdash;in reality only

as symbols of the most universal facts, of which music alone can speak

directly. If, however, we felt as purely Dionysian beings, myth as a

symbol would stand by us absolutely ineffective and unnoticed, and

would never for a moment prevent us from giving ear to the re-echo of

the <i>universalia ante rem.</i> Here, however, the <i>Apollonian</i> power, with

a view to the restoration of the well-nigh shattered individual, bursts

forth with the healing balm of a blissful illusion: all of a sudden

we imagine we see only Tristan, motionless, with hushed voice saying

to himself: "the old tune, why does it wake me?" And what formerly

interested us like a hollow sigh from the heart of being, seems now

only to tell us how "waste and void is the sea." And when, breathless,

we thought to expire by a convulsive distention of all our feelings,

and only a slender tie bound us to our present existence, we now hear

and see only the hero wounded to death and still not dying, with his

despairing cry: "Longing! Longing! In dying still longing! for longing

not dying!" And if formerly, after such a surplus and superabundance of

consuming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> agonies, the jubilation of the born rent our hearts almost

like the very acme of agony, the rejoicing Kurwenal now stands between

us and the "jubilation as such," with face turned toward the ship which

carries Isolde. However powerfully fellow-suffering encroaches upon us,

it nevertheless delivers us in a manner from the primordial suffering

of the world, just as the symbol-image of the myth delivers us from the

immediate perception of the highest cosmic idea, just as the thought

and word deliver us from the unchecked effusion of the unconscious

will. The glorious Apollonian illusion makes it appear as if the very

realm of tones presented itself to us as a plastic cosmos, as if even

the fate of Tristan and Isolde had been merely formed and moulded

therein as out of some most delicate and impressible material.</p>



<p>Thus does the Apollonian wrest us from Dionysian universality and fill

us with rapture for individuals; to these it rivets our sympathetic

emotion, through these it satisfies the sense of beauty which longs for

great and sublime forms; it brings before us biographical portraits,

and incites us to a thoughtful apprehension of the essence of life

contained therein. With the immense potency of the image, the concept,

the ethical teaching and the sympathetic emotion&mdash;the Apollonian

influence uplifts man from his orgiastic self-annihilation, and

beguiles him concerning the universality of the Dionysian process

into the belief that he is seeing a detached picture of the world,

for instance, Tristan and Isolde,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> and that, <i>through music,</i> he will

be enabled to <i>see</i> it still more clearly and intrinsically. What can

the healing magic of Apollo not accomplish when it can even excite in

us the illusion that the Dionysian is actually in the service of the

Apollonian, the effects of which it is capable of enhancing; yea, that

music is essentially the representative art for an Apollonian substance?</p>



<p>With the pre-established harmony which obtains between perfect drama

and its music, the drama attains the highest degree of conspicuousness,

such as is usually unattainable in mere spoken drama. As all the

animated figures of the scene in the independently evolved lines

of melody simplify themselves before us to the distinctness of the

catenary curve, the coexistence of these lines is also audible in the

harmonic change which sympathises in a most delicate manner with the

evolved process: through which change the relations of things become

immediately perceptible to us in a sensible and not at all abstract

manner, as we likewise perceive thereby that it is only in these

relations that the essence of a character and of a line of melody

manifests itself clearly. And while music thus compels us to see more

extensively and more intrinsically than usual, and makes us spread out

the curtain of the scene before ourselves like some delicate texture,

the world of the stage is as infinitely expanded for our spiritualised,

introspective eye as it is illumined outwardly from within. How can

the word-poet furnish anything analogous, who strives to attain this

internal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> expansion and illumination of the visible stage-world by a

much more imperfect mechanism and an indirect path, proceeding as he

does from word and concept? Albeit musical tragedy likewise avails

itself of the word, it is at the same time able to place alongside

thereof its basis and source, and can make the unfolding of the word,

from within outwards, obvious to us.</p>



<p>Of the process just set forth, however, it could still be said

as decidedly that it is only a glorious appearance, namely the

afore-mentioned Apollonian <i>illusion,</i> through the influence of which

we are to be delivered from the Dionysian obtrusion and excess.

In point of fact, the relation of music to drama is precisely the

reverse; music is the adequate idea of the world, drama is but the

reflex of this idea, a detached umbrage thereof. The identity between

the line of melody and the lining form, between the harmony and the

character-relations of this form, is true in a sense antithetical to

what one would suppose on the contemplation of musical tragedy. We

may agitate and enliven the form in the most conspicuous manner, and

enlighten it from within, but it still continues merely phenomenon,

from which there is no bridge to lead us into the true reality, into

the heart of the world. Music, however, speaks out of this heart; and

though countless phenomena of the kind might be passing manifestations

of this music, they could never exhaust its essence, but would always

be merely its externalised copies. Of course, as regards the intricate

relation of music and drama, nothing can be explained,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> while all may

be confused by the popular and thoroughly false antithesis of soul and

body; but the unphilosophical crudeness of this antithesis seems to

have become&mdash;who knows for what reasons&mdash;a readily accepted Article of

Faith with our æstheticians, while they have learned nothing concerning

an antithesis of phenomenon and thing-in-itself, or perhaps, for

reasons equally unknown, have not cared to learn anything thereof.</p>



<p>Should it have been established by our analysis that the Apollonian

element in tragedy has by means of its illusion gained a complete

victory over the Dionysian primordial element of music, and has made

music itself subservient to its end, namely, the highest and clearest

elucidation of the drama, it would certainly be necessary to add the

very important restriction: that at the most essential point this

Apollonian illusion is dissolved and annihilated. The drama, which, by

the aid of music, spreads out before us with such inwardly illumined

distinctness in all its movements and figures, that we imagine we

see the texture unfolding on the loom as the shuttle flies to and

fro,&mdash;attains as a whole an effect which <i>transcends all Apollonian

artistic effects.</i> In the collective effect of tragedy, the Dionysian

gets the upper hand once more; tragedy ends with a sound which could

never emanate from the realm of Apollonian art. And the Apollonian

illusion is thereby found to be what it is,&mdash;the assiduous veiling

during the performance of tragedy of the intrinsically Dionysian

effect: which, however, is so powerful, that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> finally forces

the Apollonian drama itself into a sphere where it begins to talk

with Dionysian wisdom, and even denies itself and its Apollonian

conspicuousness. Thus then the intricate relation of the Apollonian and

the Dionysian in tragedy must really be symbolised by a fraternal union

of the two deities: Dionysus speaks the language of Apollo; Apollo,

however, finally speaks the language of Dionysus; and so the highest

goal of tragedy and of art in general is attained.</p>







<h4>22.</h4>





<p>Let the attentive friend picture to himself purely and simply,

according to his experiences, the effect of a true musical tragedy. I

think I have so portrayed the phenomenon of this effect in both its

phases that he will now be able to interpret his own experiences. For

he will recollect that with regard to the myth which passed before

him he felt himself exalted to a kind of omniscience, as if his

visual faculty were no longer merely a surface faculty, but capable

of penetrating into the interior, and as if he now saw before him,

with the aid of music, the ebullitions of the will, the conflict of

motives, and the swelling stream of the passions, almost sensibly

visible, like a plenitude of actively moving lines and figures, and

could thereby dip into the most tender secrets of unconscious emotions.

While he thus becomes conscious of the highest exaltation of his

instincts for conspicuousness and transfiguration, he nevertheless

feels with equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> definitiveness that this long series of Apollonian

artistic effects still does <i>not</i> generate the blissful continuance in

will-less contemplation which the plasticist and the epic poet, that

is to say, the strictly Apollonian artists, produce in him by their

artistic productions: to wit, the justification of the world of the

<i>individuatio</i> attained in this contemplation,&mdash;which is the object

and essence of Apollonian art. He beholds the transfigured world of

the stage and nevertheless denies it. He sees before him the tragic

hero in epic clearness and beauty, and nevertheless delights in his

annihilation. He comprehends the incidents of the scene in all their

details, and yet loves to flee into the incomprehensible. He feels the

actions of the hero to be justified, and is nevertheless still more

elated when these actions annihilate their originator. He shudders at

the sufferings which will befall the hero, and yet anticipates therein

a higher and much more overpowering joy. He sees more extensively and

profoundly than ever, and yet wishes to be blind. Whence must we derive

this curious internal dissension, this collapse of the Apollonian apex,

if not from the <i>Dionysian</i> spell, which, though apparently stimulating

the Apollonian emotions to their highest pitch, can nevertheless force

this superabundance of Apollonian power into its service? <i>Tragic

myth</i> is to be understood only as a symbolisation of Dionysian wisdom

by means of the expedients of Apollonian art: the mythus conducts the

world of phenomena to its boundaries, where it denies itself, and seeks

to flee back again into the bosom of the true and only reality; where

it then, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> Isolde, seems to strike up its metaphysical swan-song:&mdash;</p>

<p>We thus realise to ourselves in the experiences of the truly æsthetic

hearer the tragic artist himself when he proceeds like a luxuriously

fertile divinity of individuation to create his figures (in which sense

his work can hardly be understood as an "imitation of nature")&mdash;and

when, on the other hand, his vast Dionysian impulse then absorbs the

entire world of phenomena, in order to anticipate beyond it, and

through its annihilation, the highest artistic primal joy, in the bosom

of the Primordial Unity. Of course, our æsthetes have nothing to say

about this return in fraternal union of the two art-deities to the

original home, nor of either the Apollonian or Dionysian excitement

of the hearer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span> while they are indefatigable in characterising the

struggle of the hero with fate, the triumph of the moral order of the

world, or the disburdenment of the emotions through tragedy, as the

properly Tragic: an indefatigableness which makes me think that they

are perhaps not æsthetically excitable men at all, but only to be

regarded as moral beings when hearing tragedy. Never since Aristotle

has an explanation of the tragic effect been proposed, by which an

æsthetic activity of the hearer could be inferred from artistic

circumstances. At one time fear and pity are supposed to be forced to

an alleviating discharge through the serious procedure, at another time

we are expected to feel elevated and inspired at the triumph of good

and noble principles, at the sacrifice of the hero in the interest of

a moral conception of things; and however certainly I believe that for

countless men precisely this, and only this, is the effect of tragedy,

it as obviously follows therefrom that all these, together with their

interpreting æsthetes, have had no experience of tragedy as the highest

<i>art.</i> The pathological discharge, the catharsis of Aristotle, which

philologists are at a loss whether to include under medicinal or moral

phenomena, recalls a remarkable anticipation of Goethe. "Without a

lively pathological interest," he says, "I too have never yet succeeded

in elaborating a tragic situation of any kind, and hence I have rather

avoided than sought it. Can it perhaps have been still another of the

merits of the ancients that the deepest pathos was with them merely

æsthetic play, whereas with us the truth of nature must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> co-operate in

order to produce such a work?" We can now answer in the affirmative

this latter profound question after our glorious experiences, in which

we have found to our astonishment in the case of musical tragedy

itself, that the deepest pathos can in reality be merely æsthetic play:

and therefore we are justified in believing that now for the first time

the proto-phenomenon of the tragic can be portrayed with some degree

of success. He who now will still persist in talking only of those

vicarious effects proceeding from ultra-æsthetic spheres, and does not

feel himself raised above the pathologically-moral process, may be left

to despair of his æsthetic nature: for which we recommend to him, by

way of innocent equivalent, the interpretation of Shakespeare after the

fashion of Gervinus, and the diligent search for poetic justice.</p>



<p>Thus with the re-birth of tragedy the <i>æsthetic hearer</i> is also

born anew, in whose place in the theatre a curious <i>quid pro quo</i>

was wont to sit with half-moral and half-learned pretensions,&mdash;the

"critic." In his sphere hitherto everything has been artificial and

merely glossed over with a semblance of life. The performing artist

was in fact at a loss what to do with such a critically comporting

hearer, and hence he, as well as the dramatist or operatic composer

who inspired him, searched anxiously for the last remains of life

in a being so pretentiously barren and incapable of enjoyment. Such

"critics," however, have hitherto constituted the public; the student,

the school-boy, yea, even the most harmless womanly creature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> were

already unwittingly prepared by education and by journals for a similar

perception of works of art. The nobler natures among the artists

counted upon exciting the moral-religious forces in such a public,

and the appeal to a moral order of the world operated vicariously,

when in reality some powerful artistic spell should have enraptured

the true hearer. Or again, some imposing or at all events exciting

tendency of the contemporary political and social world was presented

by the dramatist with such vividness that the hearer could forget his

critical exhaustion and abandon himself to similar emotions, as, in

patriotic or warlike moments, before the tribune of parliament, or

at the condemnation of crime and vice:&mdash;an estrangement of the true

aims of art which could not but lead directly now and then to a cult

of tendency. But here there took place what has always taken place

in the case of factitious arts, an extraordinary rapid depravation

of these tendencies, so that for instance the tendency to employ the

theatre as a means for the moral education of the people, which in

Schiller's time was taken seriously, is already reckoned among the

incredible antiquities of a surmounted culture. While the critic got

the upper hand in the theatre and concert-hall, the journalist in the

school, and the press in society, art degenerated into a topic of

conversation of the most trivial kind, and æsthetic criticism was used

as the cement of a vain, distracted, selfish and moreover piteously

unoriginal sociality, the significance of which is suggested by the

Schopenhauerian parable of the porcupines, so that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> has never

been so much gossip about art and so little esteem for it. But is it

still possible to have intercourse with a man capable of conversing on

Beethoven or Shakespeare? Let each answer this question according to

his sentiments: he will at any rate show by his answer his conception

of "culture," provided he tries at least to answer the question, and

has not already grown mute with astonishment.</p>



<p>On the other hand, many a one more nobly and delicately endowed by

nature, though he may have gradually become a critical barbarian

in the manner described, could tell of the unexpected as well as

totally unintelligible effect which a successful performance of

<i>Lohengrin,</i> for example, exerted on him: except that perhaps every

warning and interpreting hand was lacking to guide him; so that the

incomprehensibly heterogeneous and altogether incomparable sensation

which then affected him also remained isolated and became extinct, like

a mysterious star after a brief brilliancy. He then divined what the

æsthetic hearer is.</p>

<p>He who wishes to test himself rigorously as to how he is related to the

true æsthetic hearer, or whether he belongs rather to the community

of the Socrato-critical man, has only to enquire sincerely concerning

the sentiment with which he accepts the <i>wonder</i> represented on the

stage: whether he feels his historical sense, which insists on strict

psychological causality, insulted by it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> whether with benevolent

concession he as it were admits the wonder as a phenomenon intelligible

to childhood, but relinquished by him, or whether he experiences

anything else thereby. For he will thus be enabled to determine how

far he is on the whole capable of understanding <i>myth,</i> that is to

say, the concentrated picture of the world, which, as abbreviature of

phenomena, cannot dispense with wonder. It is probable, however, that

nearly every one, upon close examination, feels so disintegrated by

the critico-historical spirit of our culture, that he can only perhaps

make the former existence of myth credible to himself by learned

means through intermediary abstractions. Without myth, however, every

culture loses its healthy, creative natural power: it is only a horizon

encompassed with myths which rounds off to unity a social movement.

It is only by myth that all the powers of the imagination and of the

Apollonian dream are freed from their random rovings. The mythical

figures have to be the invisibly omnipresent genii, under the care of

which the young soul grows to maturity, by the signs of which the man

gives a meaning to his life and struggles: and the state itself knows

no more powerful unwritten law than the mythical foundation which

vouches for its connection with religion and its growth from mythical

ideas.</p>



<p>Let us now place alongside thereof the abstract man proceeding

independently of myth, the abstract education, the abstract usage,

the abstract right, the abstract state: let us picture to ourselves

the lawless roving of the artistic imagination,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> not bridled by any

native myth: let us imagine a culture which has no fixed and sacred

primitive seat, but is doomed to exhaust all its possibilities, and

has to nourish itself wretchedly from the other cultures&mdash;such is the

Present, as the result of Socratism, which is bent on the destruction

of myth. And now the myth-less man remains eternally hungering among

all the bygones, and digs and grubs for roots, though he have to dig

for them even among the remotest antiquities. The stupendous historical

exigency of the unsatisfied modern culture, the gathering around one of

countless other cultures, the consuming desire for knowledge&mdash;what does

all this point to, if not to the loss of myth, the loss of the mythical

home, the mythical source? Let us ask ourselves whether the feverish

and so uncanny stirring of this culture is aught but the eager seizing

and snatching at food of the hungerer&mdash;and who would care to contribute

anything more to a culture which cannot be appeased by all it devours,

and in contact with which the most vigorous and wholesome nourishment

is wont to change into "history and criticism"?</p>



<p>We should also have to regard our German character with despair and

sorrow, if it had already become inextricably entangled in, or even

identical with this culture, in a similar manner as we can observe it

to our horror to be the case in civilised France; and that which for

a long time was the great advantage of France and the cause of her

vast preponderance, to wit, this very identity of people and culture,

might compel us at the sight thereof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> to congratulate ourselves that

this culture of ours, which is so questionable, has hitherto had

nothing in common with the noble kernel of the character of our people.

All our hopes, on the contrary, stretch out longingly towards the

perception that beneath this restlessly palpitating civilised life and

educational convulsion there is concealed a glorious, intrinsically

healthy, primeval power, which, to be sure, stirs vigorously only at

intervals in stupendous moments, and then dreams on again in view of

a future awakening. It is from this abyss that the German Reformation

came forth: in the choral-hymn of which the future melody of German

music first resounded. So deep, courageous, and soul-breathing, so

exuberantly good and tender did this chorale of Luther sound,&mdash;as the

first Dionysian-luring call which breaks forth from dense thickets

at the approach of spring. To it responded with emulative echo the

solemnly wanton procession of Dionysian revellers, to whom we are

indebted for German music&mdash;and to whom we shall be indebted for <i>the

re-birth of German myth.</i></p>



<p>I know that I must now lead the sympathising and attentive friend to

an elevated position of lonesome contemplation, where he will have

but few companions, and I call out encouragingly to him that we must

hold fast to our shining guides, the Greeks. For the rectification

of our æsthetic knowledge we previously borrowed from them the two

divine figures, each of which sways a separate realm of art, and

concerning whose mutual contact and exaltation we have acquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> a

notion through Greek tragedy. Through a remarkable disruption of both

these primitive artistic impulses, the ruin of Greek tragedy seemed

to be necessarily brought about: with which process a degeneration

and a transmutation of the Greek national character was strictly in

keeping, summoning us to earnest reflection as to how closely and

necessarily art and the people, myth and custom, tragedy and the state,

have coalesced in their bases. The ruin of tragedy was at the same

time the ruin of myth. Until then the Greeks had been involuntarily

compelled immediately to associate all experiences with their myths,

indeed they had to comprehend them only through this association:

whereby even the most immediate present necessarily appeared to them

<i>sub specie æterni</i> and in a certain sense as timeless. Into this

current of the timeless, however, the state as well as art plunged

in order to find repose from the burden and eagerness of the moment.

And a people&mdash;for the rest, also a man&mdash;is worth just as much only as

its ability to impress on its experiences the seal of eternity: for

it is thus, as it were, desecularised, and reveals its unconscious

inner conviction of the relativity of time and of the true, that is,

the metaphysical significance of life. The contrary happens when a

people begins to comprehend itself historically and to demolish the

mythical bulwarks around it: with which there is usually connected

a marked secularisation, a breach with the unconscious metaphysics

of its earlier existence, in all ethical consequences. Greek art and

especially Greek tragedy delayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> above all the annihilation of myth:

it was necessary to annihilate these also to be able to live detached

from the native soil, unbridled in the wilderness of thought, custom,

and action. Even in such circumstances this metaphysical impulse still

endeavours to create for itself a form of apotheosis (weakened, no

doubt) in the Socratism of science urging to life: but on its lower

stage this same impulse led only to a feverish search, which gradually

merged into a pandemonium of myths and superstitions accumulated from

all quarters: in the midst of which, nevertheless, the Hellene sat with

a yearning heart till he contrived, as Græculus, to mask his fever with

Greek cheerfulness and Greek levity, or to narcotise himself completely

with some gloomy Oriental superstition.</p>



<p>We have approached this condition in the most striking manner since the

reawakening of the Alexandro&mdash;Roman antiquity in the fifteenth century,

after a long, not easily describable, interlude. On the heights there

is the same exuberant love of knowledge, the same insatiate happiness

of the discoverer, the same stupendous secularisation, and, together

with these, a homeless roving about, an eager intrusion at foreign

tables, a frivolous deification of the present or a dull senseless

estrangement, all <i>sub speci sæculi,</i> of the present time: which

same symptoms lead one to infer the same defect at the heart of

this culture, the annihilation of myth. It seems hardly possible to

transplant a foreign myth with permanent success, without dreadfully

injuring the tree through this transplantation: which is perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>

occasionally strong enough and sound enough to eliminate the foreign

element after a terrible struggle; but must ordinarily consume itself

in a languishing and stunted condition or in sickly luxuriance. Our

opinion of the pure and vigorous kernel of the German being is such

that we venture to expect of it, and only of it, this elimination of

forcibly ingrafted foreign elements, and we deem it possible that

the German spirit will reflect anew on itself. Perhaps many a one

will be of opinion that this spirit must begin its struggle with the

elimination of the Romanic element: for which it might recognise an

external preparation and encouragement in the victorious bravery and

bloody glory of the late war, but must seek the inner constraint in the

emulative zeal to be for ever worthy of the sublime protagonists on

this path, of Luther as well as our great artists and poets. But let

him never think he can fight such battles without his household gods,

without his mythical home, without a "restoration" of all German things

I And if the German should look timidly around for a guide to lead

him back to his long-lost home, the ways and paths of which he knows

no longer&mdash;let him but listen to the delightfully luring call of the

Dionysian bird, which hovers above him, and would fain point out to him

the way thither.</p>







<h4>24.</h4>





<p>Among the peculiar artistic effects of musical tragedy we had to

emphasise an Apollonian <i>illusion,</i> through which we are to be saved

from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span> immediate oneness with the Dionysian music, while our musical

excitement is able to discharge itself on an Apollonian domain and

in an interposed visible middle world. It thereby seemed to us that

precisely through this discharge the middle world of theatrical

procedure, the drama generally, became visible and intelligible from

within in a degree unattainable in the other forms of Apollonian art:

so that here, where this art was as it were winged and borne aloft by

the spirit of music, we had to recognise the highest exaltation of its

powers, and consequently in the fraternal union of Apollo and Dionysus

the climax of the Apollonian as well as of the Dionysian artistic aims.</p>



<p>Of course, the Apollonian light-picture did not, precisely with this

inner illumination through music, attain the peculiar effect of the

weaker grades of Apollonian art. What the epos and the animated stone

can do&mdash;constrain the contemplating eye to calm delight in the world

of the <i>individuatio</i>&mdash;could not be realised here, notwithstanding

the greater animation and distinctness. We contemplated the drama

and penetrated with piercing glance into its inner agitated world of

motives&mdash;and yet it seemed as if only a symbolic picture passed before

us, the profoundest significance of which we almost believed we had

divined, and which we desired to put aside like a curtain in order to

behold the original behind it. The greatest distinctness of the picture

did not suffice us: for it seemed to reveal as well as veil something;

and while it seemed, with its symbolic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> revelation, to invite the

rending of the veil for the disclosure of the mysterious background,

this illumined all-conspicuousness itself enthralled the eye and

prevented it from penetrating more deeply He who has not experienced

this,&mdash;to have to view, and at the same time to have a longing

beyond the viewing,&mdash;will hardly be able to conceive how clearly and

definitely these two processes coexist in the contemplation of tragic

myth and are felt to be conjoined; while the truly æsthetic spectators

will confirm my assertion that among the peculiar effects of tragedy

this conjunction is the most noteworthy. Now let this phenomenon of the

æsthetic spectator be transferred to an analogous process in the tragic

artist, and the genesis of <i>tragic myth</i> will have been understood. It

shares with the Apollonian sphere of art the full delight in appearance

and contemplation, and at the same time it denies this delight and

finds a still higher satisfaction in the annihilation of the visible

world of appearance. The substance of tragic myth is first of all an

epic event involving the glorification of the fighting hero: but whence

originates the essentially enigmatical trait, that the suffering in

the fate of the hero, the most painful victories, the most agonising

contrasts of motives, in short, the exemplification of the wisdom of

Silenus, or, æsthetically expressed, the Ugly and Discordant, is always

represented anew in such countless forms with such predilection, and

precisely in the most youthful and exuberant age of a people, unless

there is really a higher delight experienced in all this?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>



<p>For the fact that things actually take such a tragic course would

least of all explain the origin of a form of art; provided that art

is not merely an imitation of the reality of nature, but in truth a

metaphysical supplement to the reality of nature, placed alongside

thereof for its conquest. Tragic myth, in so far as it really belongs

to art, also fully participates in this transfiguring metaphysical

purpose of art in general: What does it transfigure, however, when it

presents the phenomenal world in the guise of the suffering hero? Least

of all the "reality" of this phenomenal world, for it says to us: "Look

at this! Look carefully! It is your life! It is the hour-hand of your

clock of existence!"</p>



<p>And myth has displayed this life, in order thereby to transfigure it

to us? If not, how shall we account for the æsthetic pleasure with

which we make even these representations pass before us? I am inquiring

concerning the æsthetic pleasure, and am well aware that many of

these representations may moreover occasionally create even a moral

delectation, say under the form of pity or of a moral triumph. But he

who would derive the effect of the tragic exclusively from these moral

sources, as was usually the case far too long in æsthetics, let him not

think that he has done anything for Art thereby; for Art must above all

insist on purity in her domain. For the explanation of tragic myth the

very first requirement is that the pleasure which characterises it must

be sought in the purely æsthetic sphere, without encroaching on the

domain of pity, fear, or the morally-sublime.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> How can the ugly and the

discordant, the substance of tragic myth, excite an æsthetic pleasure?</p>



<p>Here it is necessary to raise ourselves with a daring bound into a

metaphysics of Art. I repeat, therefore, my former proposition, that

it is only as an æsthetic phenomenon that existence and the world,

appear justified: and in this sense it is precisely the function of

tragic myth to convince us that even the Ugly and Discordant is an

artistic game which the will, in the eternal fulness of its joy, plays

with itself. But this not easily comprehensible proto-phenomenon of

Dionysian Art becomes, in a direct way, singularly intelligible, and

is immediately apprehended in the wonderful significance of <i>musical

dissonance:</i> just as in general it is music alone, placed in contrast

to the world, which can give us an idea as to what is meant by the

justification of the world as an æsthetic phenomenon. The joy that the

tragic myth excites has the same origin as the joyful sensation of

dissonance in music. The Dionysian, with its primitive joy experienced

in pain itself, is the common source of music and tragic myth.</p>



<p>Is it not possible that by calling to our aid the musical relation of

dissonance, the difficult problem of tragic effect may have meanwhile

been materially facilitated? For we now understand what it means to

wish to view tragedy and at the same time to have a longing beyond the

viewing: a frame of mind, which, as regards the artistically employed

dissonance, we should simply have to characterise by saying that we

desire to hear and at the same time have a longing beyond the hearing.

That striving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> for the infinite, the pinion-flapping of longing,

accompanying the highest delight in the clearly-perceived reality,

remind one that in both states we have to recognise a Dionysian

phenomenon, which again and again reveals to us anew the playful

up-building and demolishing of the world of individuals as the efflux

of a primitive delight, in like manner as when Heraclitus the Obscure

compares the world-building power to a playing child which places

stones here and there and builds sandhills only to overthrow them again.</p>



<p>Hence, in order to form a true estimate of the Dionysian capacity of

a people, it would seem that we must think not only of their music,

but just as much of their tragic myth, the second witness of this

capacity. Considering this most intimate relationship between music

and myth, we may now in like manner suppose that a degeneration and

depravation of the one involves a deterioration of the other: if it be

true at all that the weakening of the myth is generally expressive of

a debilitation of the Dionysian capacity. Concerning both, however,

a glance at the development of the German genius should not leave

us in any doubt; in the opera just as in the abstract character of

our myth-less existence, in an art sunk to pastime just as in a life

guided by concepts, the inartistic as well as life-consuming nature

of Socratic optimism had revealed itself to us. Yet there have been

indications to console us that nevertheless in some inaccessible abyss

the German spirit still rests and dreams, undestroyed, in glorious

health, profundity, and Dionysian strength, like a knight sunk in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>

slumber: from which abyss the Dionysian song rises to us to let us

know that this German knight even still dreams his primitive Dionysian

myth in blissfully earnest visions. Let no one believe that the German

spirit has for ever lost its mythical home when it still understands so

obviously the voices of the birds which tell of that home. Some day it

will find itself awake in all the morning freshness of a deep sleep:

then it will slay the dragons, destroy the malignant dwarfs, and waken

Brünnhilde&mdash;and Wotan's spear itself will be unable to obstruct its

course!</p>



<p>My friends, ye who believe in Dionysian music, ye know also what

tragedy means to us. There we have tragic myth, born anew from

music,&mdash;and in this latest birth ye can hope for everything and forget

what is most afflicting. What is most afflicting to all of us, however,

is&mdash;the prolonged degradation in which the German genius has lived

estranged from house and home in the service of malignant dwarfs. Ye

understand my allusion&mdash;as ye will also, in conclusion, understand my

hopes.</p>







<h4>25.</h4>





<p>Music and tragic myth are equally the expression of the Dionysian

capacity of a people, and are inseparable from each other. Both

originate in an ultra Apollonian sphere of art; both transfigure a

region in the delightful accords of which all dissonance, just like

the terrible picture of the world, dies charmingly away; both play

with the sting of displeasure, trusting to their most potent magic;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>

both justify thereby the existence even of the "worst world." Here

the Dionysian, as compared with the Apollonian, exhibits itself as

the eternal and original artistic force, which in general calls into

existence the entire world of phenomena: in the midst of which a new

transfiguring appearance becomes necessary, in order to keep alive the

animated world of individuation. If we could conceive an incarnation

of dissonance&mdash;and what is man but that?&mdash;then, to be able to live

this dissonance would require a glorious illusion which would spread

a veil of beauty over its peculiar nature. This is the true function

of Apollo as deity of art: in whose name we comprise all the countless

manifestations of the fair realm of illusion, which each moment render

life in general worth living and make one impatient for the experience

of the next moment.</p>



<p>At the same time, just as much of this basis of all existence&mdash;the

Dionysian substratum of the world&mdash;is allowed to enter into the

consciousness of human beings, as can be surmounted again by the

Apollonian transfiguring power, so that these two art-impulses are

constrained to develop their powers in strictly mutual proportion,

according to the law of eternal justice. When the Dionysian powers rise

with such vehemence as we exp<span style="font-size: 0.8em;"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;"></span></span>erience at present, there can be no doubt

that, veiled in a cloud, Apollo has already descended to us; whose

grandest beautifying influences a coming generation will perhaps behold.</p>



<p>That this effect is necessary, however, each one would most surely

perceive by intuition, if once he found himself carried back&mdash;even in

a dream&mdash;into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> an Old-Hellenic existence. In walking under high Ionic

colonnades, looking upwards to a horizon defined by clear and noble

lines, with reflections of his transfigured form by his side in shining

marble, and around him solemnly marching or quietly moving men, with

harmoniously sounding voices and rhythmical pantomime, would he not in

the presence of this perpetual influx of beauty have to raise his hand

to Apollo and exclaim: "Blessed race of Hellenes! How great Dionysus

must be among you, when the Delian god deems such charms necessary

to cure you of your dithyrambic madness!"&mdash;To one in this frame of

mind, however, an aged Athenian, looking up to him with the sublime

eye of Æschylus, might answer: "Say also this, thou curious stranger:

what sufferings this people must have undergone, in order to be able

to become thus beautiful! But now follow me to a tragic play, and

sacrifice with me in the temple of both the deities!"</p>

<h4>APPENDIX.</h4>



<p>[Late in the year 1888, not long before he was overcome by his sudden

attack of insanity, Nietzsche wrote down a few notes concerning

his early work, the <i>Birth of Tragedy.</i> These were printed in his

sister's biography (<i>Das Leben Friedrich Nietzsches,</i> vol. ii. pt.

i. pp. 102 ff.), and are here translated as likely to be of interest

to readers of this remarkable work. They also appear in the <i>Ecce

Homo.</i>&mdash;<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">TRANSLATOR'S NOTE</span>.]</p>



<p>"To be just to the <i>Birth of Tragedy</i>(1872), one will have to forget

some few things. It has <i>wrought effects,</i> it even fascinated through

that wherein it was amiss&mdash;through its application to <i>Wagnerism,</i>

just as if this Wagnerism were symptomatic of <i>a rise and going up.</i>

And just on that account was the book an event in Wagner's life: from

thence and only from thence were great hopes linked to the name of

Wagner. Even to-day people remind me, sometimes right in the midst of

a talk on <i>Parsifal,</i> that <i>I</i> and none other have it on my conscience

that such a high opinion of the <i>cultural value</i> of this movement came

to the top. More than once have I found the book referred to as 'the

<i>Re</i>-birth of Tragedy out of the Spirit of Music': one only had an ear

for a new formula of <i>Wagner's</i> art, aim, task,&mdash;and failed to hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>

withal what was at bottom valuable therein. 'Hellenism and Pessimism'

had been a more unequivocal title: namely, as a first lesson on the

way in which the Greeks got the better of pessimism,&mdash;on the means

whereby they <i>overcame</i> it. Tragedy simply proves that the Greeks were

<i>no</i> pessimists: Schopenhauer was mistaken here as he was mistaken

in all other things. Considered with some neutrality, the <i>Birth of

Tragedy</i> appears very unseasonable: one would not even dream that

it was <i>begun</i> amid the thunders of the battle of Wörth. I thought

these problems through and through before the walls of Metz in cold

September nights, in the midst of the work of nursing the sick; one

might even believe the book to be fifty years older. It is politically

indifferent&mdash;un-German one will say to-day,&mdash;it smells shockingly

Hegelian, in but a few formulæ does it scent of Schopenhauer's

funereal perfume. An 'idea'&mdash;the antithesis of 'Dionysian <i>versus</i>

Apollonian'&mdash;translated into metaphysics; history itself as the

evolution of this 'idea'; the antithesis dissolved into oneness

in Tragedy; through this optics things that had never yet looked

into one another's face, confronted of a sudden, and illumined and

<i>comprehended</i> through one another: for instance, Opera and Revolution.

The two decisive <i>innovations</i> of the book are, on the one hand, the

comprehension of the <i>Dionysian</i> phenomenon among the Greeks (it gives

the first psychology thereof, it sees therein the One root of all

Grecian art); on the other, the comprehension of Socratism: Socrates

diagnosed for the first time as the tool<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> of Grecian dissolution, as

a typical decadent. 'Rationality' <i>against</i> instinct! 'Rationality'

at any price as a dangerous, as a life-undermining force! Throughout

the whole book a deep hostile silence on Christianity: it is neither

Apollonian nor Dionysian; it <i>negatives</i> all <i>æsthetic</i> values (the

only values recognised by the <i>Birth of Tragedy),</i> it is in the widest

sense nihilistic, whereas in the Dionysian symbol the utmost limit

of <i>affirmation</i> is reached. Once or twice the Christian priests are

alluded to as a 'malignant kind of dwarfs,' as 'subterraneans.'"</p>







<h4>2.</h4>





<p>"This beginning is singular beyond measure. I had for my own inmost

experience <i>discovered</i> the only symbol and counterpart of history,&mdash;I

had just thereby been the first to grasp the wonderful phenomenon

of the Dionysian. And again, through my diagnosing Socrates as a

decadent, I had given a wholly unequivocal proof of how little risk

the trustworthiness of my psychological grasp would run of being

weakened by some moralistic idiosyncrasy&mdash;to view morality itself as a

symptom of decadence is an innovation, a novelty of the first rank in

the history of knowledge. How far I had leaped in either case beyond

the smug shallow-pate-gossip of optimism <i>contra</i> pessimism! I was

the first to see the intrinsic antithesis: here, the <i>degenerating</i>

instinct which, with subterranean vindictiveness, turns against life

(Christianity, the philosophy of Schopenhauer, in a certain sense

already the philosophy of Plato, all idealistic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> systems as typical

forms), and there, a formula of <i>highest affirmation,</i> born of fullness

and overfullness, a yea-saying without reserve to suffering's self,

to guilt's self, to all that is questionable and strange in existence

itself. This final, cheerfullest, exuberantly mad-and-merriest Yea to

life is not only the highest insight, it is also the <i>deepest,</i> it

is that which is most rigorously confirmed and upheld by truth and

science. Naught that is, is to be deducted, naught is dispensable; the

phases of existence rejected by the Christians and other nihilists are

even of an infinitely higher order in the hierarchy of values than

that which the instinct of decadence sanctions, yea durst <i>sanction.</i>

To comprehend this <i>courage</i> is needed, and, as a condition thereof, a

surplus of <i>strength</i>: for precisely in degree as courage <i>dares</i> to

thrust forward, precisely according to the measure of strength, does

one approach truth. Perception, the yea-saying to reality, is as much

a necessity to the strong as to the weak, under the inspiration of

weakness, cowardly shrinking, and <i>flight</i> from reality&mdash;the 'ideal.'

... They are not free to perceive: the decadents have <i>need</i> of the

lie,&mdash;it is one of their conditions of self-preservation. Whoso not

only comprehends the word Dionysian, but also grasps his <i>self</i> in

this word, requires no refutation of Plato or of Christianity or of

Schopenhauer&mdash;<i>he smells the putrefaction.</i>"</p>







<h4>3.</h4>





<p>"To what extent I had just thereby found the concept 'tragic,' the

definitive perception of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>

psychology of tragedy, I have but lately stated in the <i>Twilight of the

Idols,</i> page 139 (1st edit.): 'The affirmation of life, even in its

most unfamiliar and severe problems, the will to life, enjoying its

own inexhaustibility in the sacrifice of its highest types,&mdash;<i>that</i>

is what I called Dionysian, that is what I divined as the bridge to a

psychology of the <i>tragic</i> poet. Not in order to get rid of terror and

pity, not to purify from a dangerous passion by its vehement discharge

(it was thus that Aristotle misunderstood it); but, beyond terror

and pity, <i>to realise in fact</i> the eternal delight of becoming, that

delight which even involves in itself the <i>joy of annihilating!</i><a name="FNanchor_1_28" id="FNanchor_1_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_28" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>

In this sense I have the right to understand myself to be the first

<i>tragic philosopher</i>&mdash;that is, the utmost antithesis and antipode to a

pessimistic philosopher. Prior to myself there is no such translation

of the Dionysian into the philosophic pathos: there lacks the <i>tragic

wisdom,</i>&mdash;I have sought in vain for an indication thereof even among

the <i>great</i> Greeks of philosophy, the thinkers of the two centuries

<i>before</i> Socrates. A doubt still possessed me as touching <i>Heraclitus,</i>

in whose proximity I in general begin to feel warmer and better than

anywhere else. The affirmation of transiency <i>and annihilation,</i> to

wit the decisive factor in a Dionysian <i>philosophy,</i> the yea-saying

to antithesis and war, to <i>becoming,</i> with radical rejection even of

the concept '<i>being,</i>'&mdash;that I must directly acknowledge as, of all

thinking hitherto, the nearest to my own. The doctrine of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span> 'eternal

recurrence,' that is, of the unconditioned and infinitely repeated

cycle of all things&mdash;this doctrine of Zarathustra's <i>might</i> after all

have been already taught by Heraclitus. At any rate the portico<a name="FNanchor_2_29" id="FNanchor_2_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_29" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>

which inherited well-nigh all its fundamental conceptions from

Heraclitus, shows traces thereof."</p>

<h4 class="p2">4.</h4>





<p>"In this book speaks a prodigious hope. In fine, I see no reason

whatever for taking back my hope of a Dionysian future for music. Let

us cast a glance a century ahead, let us suppose my assault upon two

millenniums of anti-nature and man-vilification succeeds! That new

party of life which will take in hand the greatest of all tasks, the

upbreeding of mankind to something higher,&mdash;add thereto the relentless

annihilation of all things degenerating and parasitic, will again make

possible on earth that <i>too-much of life,</i> from which there also must

needs grow again the Dionysian state. I promise a <i>tragic</i> age: the

highest art in the yea-saying to life, tragedy, will be born anew, when

mankind have behind them the consciousness of the hardest but most

necessary wars, <i>without suffering therefrom.</i> A psychologist might

still add that what I heard in my younger years in Wagnerian music had

in general naught to do with Wagner; that when I described Wagnerian

music I described what <i>I</i> had heard, that I had instinctively to

translate and transfigure all into the new spirit which I bore within

myself...."</p>

<h4>TRANSLATOR'S NOTE.</h4>





<p>While the translator flatters himself that this version of Nietzsche's

early work&mdash;having been submitted to unsparingly scrutinising eyes&mdash;is

not altogether unworthy of the original, he begs to state that he

holds twentieth-century English to be a rather unsatisfactory vehicle

for philosophical thought. Accordingly, in conjunction with his

friend Dr. Ernest Lacy, he has prepared a second, more unconventional

translation,&mdash;in brief, a translation which will enable one whose

knowledge of English extends to, say, the period of Elizabeth, to

appreciate Nietzsche in more forcible language, because the language of

a stronger age. It is proposed to provide this second translation with

an appendix, containing many references to the translated writings of

Wagner and Schopenhauer; to the works of Pater, Browning, Burckhardt,

Rohde, and others, and a summmary and index.</p>



<p>For help in preparing the present translation, the translator wishes

to express his thanks to his friends Dr. Ernest Lacy, Litt.D.; Dr.

James Waddell Tupper, Ph.D.; Prof. Harry Max Ferren; Mr. James M'Kirdy,

Pittsburg; and Mr. Thomas Common, Edinburgh.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm



Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of

electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of

computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It

exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations

from people in all walks of life.



Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the

assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's

goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will

remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future

generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

www.gutenberg.org

state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg

Literary Archive Foundation



Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide

spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of

increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be

freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest

array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations

($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt

status with the IRS.



The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating

charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a

considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up

with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations

where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND

DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular

state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate



While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we

have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition

against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who

approach us with offers to donate.



International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make

any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from

outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.



Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation

methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other

ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate



Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.



Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project

Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be

freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and

distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of

volunteer support.



Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed

editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in

the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not

necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper

edition.



Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search

facility: www.gutenberg.org



This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to

subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
